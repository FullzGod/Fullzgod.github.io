										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto asset market is experiencing the most turbulent times in the market’s history. Various large centralised institutions are becoming insolvent, with each week passing more news comes to light of trouble market players. In this article, we will outline how these centralised entities have harmed the market through excessive risk-taking behaviour performed in a non-transparent fashion. We will then look at how transparent DeFi protocols have performed throughout these volatile times providing examples with crypto assets held by Apollo Capital, showcasing their consistent market demand through generating consistent cash flows for liquidity providers and token holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Centralised Finance (CeFi) Troubles</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celsius is a CeFi platform that offered investors lucrative interest rates on their crypto assets held on the platform. The business was founded in 2017 and enjoyed explosive growth in the years that followed due to their widespread marketing and general ease of use for retail investors.</span><a href="https://celsius.network/about-us"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">According to their website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Celsius was managing US$11.82 billion in assets (17 May 2022) and had processed US$8.2 billion in loans, making them an important crypto market participant for many years.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1512 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--1024x753.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="552" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--1024x753.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--300x221.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--768x565.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius-.jpg 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Celsius&#8217;s Announcement to their Users on the 12th of June 2022</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On 12 June 2022, Celsius announced that it was suspending “all withdrawals, swaps and transfers between accounts”. The freezing of customers&#8217; assets caught many users off guard, as they viewed Celsius as a reliable and safe way to store their crypto assets as advertised on their social media, website and via referral partners. Also portrayed in their messaging were their safe and reliable yield generating practices which lead users to believed Celsius generated the yield for their customers through direct crypto lending and conservative DeFi practices. In reality, they were undertaking riskier business practices to earn this yield, with no transparency on their procedures and strategies. Some mainstream media outlets have previously labelled Celsius as a DeFi platform along with the various referral partners on social media. However, this was simply not the case &#8211; as DeFi protocols provide complete transparency and on-chain verification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Celsius platform, user deposits are treated as a liability on the balance sheet, similar to a bank. The platform’s underlying profitability depends on its ability to take these deposits and earn a higher yield than they are required to pay depositors. With insufficient demand from the market for direct crypto loans, CeFi platforms allocate their assets into DeFi protocols and staking to meet their yield targets. The key events that led to the insolvency of Celsius included losing 38,000 ETH to the platform ‘Stakehound’, losing US$54 million in the Badger DAO hack, general liquidity requirements mismanagement and large user withdrawals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the full extent of the Celsius collapse is yet to be realised, it is the everyday user who suffers due to the risk-taking behaviour of a centralised entity. While hacks in DeFi can also be devastating for retail users, CeFi platforms have long engaged in marketing tactics that entice less sophisticated investors to utilise their products and carry the risk. </span></p>
<p><b>Risky Lending Practices &#8211; Three Arrows Capital (3AC)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before its insolvency, Three Arrows Capital was a proprietary trading firm that earned a considerable reputation in the crypto market by making concentrated bets and securing enormous profits. They were highly sought after VC style investors in the primary markets and amassed US$10-15 billion in assets throughout the bull market. Their downfall was catalysed by enormous losses from the collapse of LUNA and the following broader market sell off. It is rumoured that 3AC’s debt could amount to around US$1 billion, with the flow on effects likely to have a lasting impact on both retail and institutional investors alike.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder of Three Arrows Capital, Zhu Su broke his Twitter silence with this tweet on the 15th of June.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1521 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--1024x516.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="378" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--1024x516.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--300x151.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--768x387.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su-.jpg 1166w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3AC used their reputation to gain under-collateralised credit lines from risk seeking centralised lenders who were fiercely competing with each other, leading to irresponsible lending practices. It is reasonable to assume that many of these lenders would not have had a clear view into the balance sheet of 3AC. Whether that was through ignorance, fraud or a mixture of both, is up for speculation. The transparency offered by decentralised finance poses a stark contrast to these centralised entities. Smart contract enabled financial applications do not distinguish between users’ reputations,  they are transparent pieces of code that simply keep functioning, day after day. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MakerDAO &amp; DAI</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MakerDAO is a great example of stability in the DeFi ecosystem despite the current market conditions and volatility caused by centralised entities and poorly designed crypto assets. After the Luna / UST collapse, one of our analysts spoke of the importance of MakerDAO and its over collateralised stablecoin DAI in an</span><a href="https://stockhead.com.au/cryptocurrency/apollos-moonshots-strength-in-maker-convex-opportunity-and-luna-crash-silver-linings/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">interview with Stockhead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. MakerDAO has demonstrated the importance of decentralisation and thoughtful design in peer-to-peer networks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can ‘mint’ DAI against the crypto asset collateral they choose to deposit into the protocol’s smart contracts. The amount of DAI minted by the user becomes a debt, repaying this debt by ‘burning’ the minted DAI plus interest unlocks this deposited collateral. DAI is pegged to the US dollar and is considered to be the most decentralised over-collateralised stablecoin. The decentralised aspect of DAI is an important reason that MakerDAO has been able to survive these market conditions and continues to flourish. The main reason for DAI’s decentralisation is because the collateral used to mint DAI are primarily the most decentralised crypto assets like ETH and BTC with the only requirement for a user to mint DAI being a crypto wallet, with no KYC needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minimum collateral ratio that users are able to borrow for certain asset types is 130%, meaning if the user wanted to borrow 10,000 DAI, they must collateralise their position with at least $13,000 worth of ETH. Also known as the liquidation ratio, if the collateralised value drops below this number, the borrower will be subject to partial liquidation to cover outstanding debt, this comes with a liquidation fee of 13%. Due to MakerDAO&#8217;s transparency and being able to view all data on the blockchain, investors do not have to worry about misleading and unethical behaviour that stems from centralised entities who have hidden information from users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Stability, Total Value Locked, Revenue, On-Chain Statistics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the recent turmoil and volatility in the crypto markets, the DAI token has proven itself as a truly stable and trustworthy stablecoin. DAI uses what is known as a Peg-Stability Module (PSM) to ensure it has a 1:1 valuation with the US Dollar. The Peg Stability Module allows users to swap a given collateral type directly for DAI at a fixed rate, rather than borrowing DAI. The PSM contract allows users to swap other stablecoins such as USDC for DAI, making DAI’s peg very stable as any variation in the price can be arbitraged. The transparency and stability achieved through the implementation and reiteration of the protocol’s design over several years is a testament to the ultimate goal of Decentralised Finance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are able to look at other stablecoins such as UST and USDT when comparing the stability of DAI’s peg. However, DAI is the only decentralised stablecoin backed by on-chain crypto, which strengthens the support of its peg. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MakerDAO is currently trading at $1020 with a market cap of $1 billion and total value locked (TVL) of approximately $7.9 billion, which accounts for over 10% of the TVL in the entire DeFi space. The amount of BTC locked in the protocol is at an all time high with approximately 68,000 BTC locked (wrapped BTC on the Ethereum blockchain). With market conditions forcing some centralised companies into insolvency, MakerDAO has generated an annual total revenue of $34.9 million, and is one of the highest grossing DeFi protocols.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Aave</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aave is a highly renowned DeFi money market where users can supply and borrow crypto assets at an interest rate determined by the supply and demand of funds in the protocol. Aave is another major DeFi protocol that has survived the test of time while centralised lenders have caused disruption and uncertainty in the market. Aave is available across many layer one ecosystems such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Artbitrum, Harmony and layer twos such as Arbitrum and Optimism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the over-collateralisation mechanics of the Aave lending market as well as the community’s careful approach to only enabling highly decentralised and ‘safe’ crypto assets, there has never been a default case or ‘bad debt’ on the platform. The trust and stability of Aave are evident through its growth in user volume to $9.74 billion of liquidity locked across 7 networks and over 13 markets. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1522 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--1024x558.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="409" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--1024x558.jpeg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--300x163.jpeg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--768x418.jpeg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms-.jpeg 1484w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Aave &#8211; TVL, Revenue, On-Chain statistics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aave has implemented many risk parameters to ensure the stability of the protocol. When market conditions change, risks change. Specific parameters include the loan to value and liquidation thresholds related to the risk of each of the assets available in the Aave protocol. A liquidation in Aave occurs when a borrower&#8217;s collateral value is not properly covering their loan/debt value, thus the user&#8217;s health factor falls below 1. To prevent these types of liquidations, Aave users are able to over-collateralise so that they can cover their debt and reduce the risk of their assets falling below their liquidation level. This has limited the number of liquidations that have occurred on the protocol and has encouraged more users to safely borrow on the protocol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the number of liquidations that have occurred on Aave’s protocol has totalled $24.2m. This number is very small compared to the total liquidation value this year of over $2 billion. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lending Market Liquidations</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1524" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="774" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI.jpg 1290w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1290px) 100vw, 1290px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAVE is currently trading at $66.30 and has a market cap of around $920m with a Total Value Locked of approximately $6.75 billion, the second highest TVL out of any protocol in the DeFi sector. The lending protocol also has an annualised total revenue of $68.6m, which the majority is distributed to the lenders on the protocol who earn interest on the capital they lend. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Uniswap</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap is the leading decentralised exchange (DEX) in DeFi. Unlike centralised exchanges and entities, Uniswaps transactions are all stored in the blockchain and are available for everyone to see &#8211; displaying their transparency and trust with its community. Using smart contract interactions, the protocol facilitates automated transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol supports thousands of digital assets and stable coins across the Ethereum ecosystem and is crucial for the stability of the DeFi sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap recently surpassed $1 trillion in lifetime transaction volume, more than any other decentralised exchange. Uniswap liquidity providers earn a percentage of the transaction fees which incentivises them to provide liquidity &#8211; which is an example of the community engagement that is supported by decentralised entities. Despite the recent downdraws in the global markets, the transaction volume on Uniswap continues to rise and many new users are interacting with the protocol. </span></p>
<p><b>Uniswap &#8211; TVL, Revenue, On-Chains statistics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap reached an all time high valuation of $45 in May of 2021. It is currently trading at $5.68 and has a fully diluted market cap of around $5.14 billion. The TVL in Uniswap is approximately $5 billion , making it the 4th largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL. Uniswaps exchange has generated an annualised total revenue of $750 million, making it the highest grossing DeFi protocol, with most of the revenue distributed to liquidity providers. The total revenue generated by the exchange is up 65.3% for the year, which illustrates the protocol&#8217;s stability and importance compared to many other centralised exchanges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Monthly DeFi revenue</b></p>
<p><b> </b><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1523 size-full" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1.jpg" alt="" width="2401" height="1260" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1.jpg 2401w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-1536x806.jpg 1536w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-2048x1075.jpg 2048w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-1568x823.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2401px) 100vw, 2401px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global financial markets continue to shake the digital asset class and challenge the stability of the decentralised financial sector. However top protocols such as MakerDao, AAVE and Uniswap have proven that they can be successful and perform well despite the turmoil caused and exhibited by centralised entities. These are just a few of the top decentralised applications that continue to generate positive cash flows in a transparent manner for token holders and users. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent correction in financial asset valuation had been a reckoning many global macro focused investors warned about for years.  The long-feared QT and interest rate normalisation have impacted liquidity and a re-rating of financial assets.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, central bank action has been limited relative to market expectations.  However, sticky inflation numbers and central bank recognition of their slow response have increased expectations for sizeable action over coming periods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first signal of a changing of the guard began in February 2021, as long-term interest rates began to rise.  That month, the US 10-year rate increased from 1.17% to 1.67%.  The technology darlings, often without any positive earnings, were in the firing line. For example, ARKK fell 34% by May 2021 and by June 14, 2022, it had dropped 76% from its Feb 2021 high.  Understandably, long duration equities are expected to deliver a higher proportion of future cash flows in the distant future and can be expected to suffer in a rising rate environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More generally, as interest rates have increased since January 2022 (US 10-year yield from 1.68% to 3.48%) the SP 500 has fallen over -22.1% from all time highs, and US government bonds (TLT -20 year) have lost -24.3% YTD (both in US$).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto and digital assets, also considered a disruptive technology, have suffered in this environment.  As of 20 June 2022, BTC/USD has fallen 70.1% from its 2021 peak, and the Crypto10 index (Top 10 crypto assets by market cap) has fallen 81.5% from its November 2021 highs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many headlines promote the demise of innovative technology and crypto with their price falls, the long-term participants in small cap technology and crypto environments have experienced frequent falls of significant magnitude in the past.  The table below highlights the volatility and price swing potential in BTC/USD. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understandably, the volatility and risk of capital loss would dictate sizing within a portfolio to be relatively small. For example, a typical allocation may be .50% to 3.0% of a total portfolio, with crypto enthusiasts holding a higher level.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Asset Allocation and Re-Balancing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our view, overall portfolio asset allocation should be constructed for all economic environments. This macro winter&#8217;s fall in bonds and equities highlights the flaws of 60/40 portfolio allocation and an overreliance on historical correlation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, allocations for growth, recession, inflation, and deflationary periods (see Permanent Portfolio or Artemis’s Dragon Portfolio) are more fundamentally diversified portfolios, enabling rebalancing when markets present opportunities. This includes selling winners and re-balancing regularly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In evaluating the impact of a 3% BTC-USD allocation to a 60/40 portfolio from 2017 to the end of May 2022, investors would still be significantly ahead.  Importantly, BTC has faced three significant ‘crypto winters’ in this 5-year period, falling over 50% on each occasion. (Dec 2017-Dec 2018 fell more than 83%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following chart and table of performance include regular re-balancing (quarterly) of a portfolio comprised of 60% SP 500, 30% TLT (20-year US bonds) and 10% ST vanguard treasury compared with a portfolio of 60% SP 500, 30% TLT (20-year US bonds), 7% ST vanguard treasury, and 3% BTCUSD.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1495" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc.jpg" alt="" width="1871" height="803" data-wp-editing="1" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc.jpg 1871w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-300x129.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-1024x439.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-768x330.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-1536x659.jpg 1536w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-1568x673.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1871px) 100vw, 1871px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As highlighted above, SP 500 and TLT (20 year) have weighed heavily in the performance attribution in this macro winter. While crypto assets have not provided diversification in this environment, they certainly are not the main culprits of capital destruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active portfolio management and the ability to take profit on the way up, rebalance, and conversely, in this environment, re-balance from cash and outperforming defensive assets into high quality risk assets at depressed pricing should continue to serve investors well.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, risk assets, including small cap innovative technology, have a role to play in prudent investment portfolios.  While no one has 100% certainty on how long this macro winter will last or how far risk assets may fall, an environment for growth assets will return at some point in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our view, Bitcoin and Ethereum are credible innovative technologies that will exist and thrive as the adoption of blockchain, smart contracts and non-inflationary assets continue to grow.  Other technology, including AAPL, AMZN, high-quality smaller cap technology companies and new digital assets, will go through a re-rating in this macro winter, and all survivors will build into the next cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sizing of higher volatile assets in a portfolio, especially within the nascent digital asset class, should be represented in small allocations.  However, as illustrated, small allocations can have a meaningful positive asymmetric impact on portfolio returns and improved risk adjusted returns &#8211; especially for investors that re-balance regularly.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading wealth management industry participant, Apollo Capital has joined the ranks of an elite global group who have been handed the honour of winning a WealthBriefing Award.</p>
<p>Apollo Capital was awarded ‘<strong>Best Digital Assets Offering (South-East Asia)</strong>’ at the <strong>Tenth Annual WealthBriefing Asia Awards 2022</strong>.</p>
<p>Showcasing ‘best of breed’ in the Asia region, the awards have been designed to recognise outstanding organisations grouped by specialism and geography which the prestigious panel of independent judges deemed to have ‘demonstrated innovation and excellence during the last year’.</p>
<p>Each of these categories is highly contested and is subject to a rigorous process before the ultimate winner is selected by the judges. It is this process that makes WealthBriefing awards so prized amongst winners.</p>
<p>The WealthBriefringAsia Awards are part of a global programme run by WealthBriefingAsia and its sister publications WealthBriefing and Family Wealth Report, encompassing all of the world’s major wealth management centres.</p>
<p>Participants around the world recognise that winning awards is particularly important in these challenging times as it gives clients a reassurance in the solidity and sustainability of the winner’s business and operating model.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting on the firm’s triumph, Henrik Andersson, CIO, Apollo Capital said:</strong> &#8220;We are delighted to be recognised in this award from WealthBriefing Asia. We at Apollo Capital have worked incredibly hard since our founding nearly four and half years ago, to stand by our tagline and bring ‘Institutional Asset Management to a New Asset Class.’ We are thrilled to have received this award, in recognition of our efforts and strong performance delivered to investors. Since expanding to Singapore nearly 12 months ago, we have been delighted with the reception from the Asian markets and continue to be impressed by their enthusiasm to learn about and invest in crypto assets.”</p>
<p><strong>ClearView Financial Media’s CEO, and Publisher of WealthBriefing, Stephen Harris, was the first to extend his congratulations to all the winners. He said:</strong> “The organisations and individuals who triumphed in these awards are all worthy winners, and I would like to extend my heartiest congratulations to the winners and to those who have put so much work into each winning submission.</p>
<p>“It is clear that the judges valued and recognised Apollo Capital’s strong performance and approach to investing in crypto assets. These awards were independently and expertly judged solely on the basis of entrants’ submissions and their responses to a number of specific questions, which were answered by focusing on the client experience rather than purely quantitative performance metrics. That is unique, and I believe, compelling feature. These awards recognise the very best operators in Asia wealth management, with ‘independence’, ‘integrity’ and ‘genuine insight’ the watchwords of the judging process &#8211; such that the awards truly reflect excellence in Asia wealth management.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s article will build on our previous article, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span></i><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/defi-tvl-boom/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeFi Total Value Locked Boom</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from September 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have witnessed considerable change in the global macroeconomic environment and crypto ecosystem during this time. These broader changes have harmed DeFi TVL. However, the fundamentals of what makes a strong DeFi ecosystem in the long term have not varied.</span></p>
<p><b>Fundamentals of Strong DeFi Ecosystems</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few key fundamentals contribute to an ecosystem&#8217;s strength and success in the DeFi sector. The first attribute of a vibrant DeFi ecosystem is a Decentralised Exchange (DEX) with high liquidity and high Total Value Locked (TVL). Traditionally successful DEXs will also have native tokens to incentivise liquidity. The largest DEXs in the market today are Uniswap and Curve. These protocols incentivise users to provide the automated market maker with liquidity for transaction fees and tokens &#8211; a current strategy we implement in our ACOF is allocating capital to the </span><a href="https://curve.fi/musd/deposit">Curve mUSD pool</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to earn an annual yield of 7.84%. For an in-depth description and demo of how DEXs operate, please refer to our </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHxgK2gDzcs&amp;t=3s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;DeFi Explained&#8217;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video covering the DEX SushiSwap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second ingredient to a thriving DeFi blockchain is to have strong, decentralised money markets (borrowing and lending protocols) that are trustworthy and reliable. Trust and reliability are commonly measured in the TVL the platforms can garner. Users feel more comfortable interacting and depositing capital into protocols that have become battle-hardened through time in the market and those that have undergone excessive code audits. Protocols that hit this profile are Aave and Compound. They are considered the most trusted protocols in this DeFi category and span multiple blockchains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last fundamental contributor to a flourishing DeFi ecosystem is the incentive programs and strategic marketing. Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche are all crypto assets held by Apollo Capital and have had their growth catalysed by large scale incentive programs targeting both developers and users. These incentive programs allocate the blockchain&#8217;s native token to protocols and yield farmers to promote TVL growth and development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we can see Avalanche is running an incentive program on one of the largest and most trusted money market protocols, AAVE. In addition, the interest in the token a DeFi user can earn supplying it. The user can also earn wrapped AVAX as a reward for utilising the AAVE.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1467 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--1024x645.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="472" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--1024x645.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--768x484.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--1536x968.jpg 1536w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--1568x988.jpg 1568w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example-.jpg 1696w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without well-established decentralised exchanges and money market protocols, blockchains will naturally have a lower TVL than other ecosystems. Algorand is another asset held by Apollo Capital with a relatively low TVL compared to another layer one chain with its decentralised money market, AlgoFi and decentralised exchange Tinyman, both still in their infancy. However, smaller ecosystems in the top 100 crypto assets such as Alogrand have the potential to increase if their dApps gain traction and strategic liquidity incentives are initiated. Ecosystems such as Solana, Avalanche and Polygon covered in this article make fantastic examples of TVL growth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Current TVL in Crypto 2022</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TVL in decentralised finance (DeFi) is currently at its lowest point in 2022. TVL has dropped from over $240B in January to around $107.6B today (-55%). This decline is due to crypto and macroeconomic factors. Luna&#8217;s failure has brought the public&#8217;s attention to DeFi. The world witnessed a $30B TVL loss in Luna&#8217;s ecosystem and represented a large proportion of TVL in DeFi. This recent event has shaken the whole DeFi sector, so we have seen recent reductions in TVL of most layer one ecosystems. Decreasing token price locked up contributes to a decrease in TVL, and the crypto market&#8217;s current correlation to the broader equities markets has also been another contributor. By the end of April 2022, the S&amp;P 500 recorded a loss of 13.8%, its worst start to the year since World War II. This negative sentiment generated from the federal reserve rate hikes and global supply constraints flowed into DeFi asset valuations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This graph illustrates the adoption of DeFi before the onset of adverse macroeconomic factors at the beginning of 2022 and the collapse of Luna (Terra) in early May 2022. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1460 aligncenter" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Ecosystem.jpg" alt="" width="737" height="442" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Ecosystem.jpg 737w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Ecosystem-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Total Value Locked in Ethereum</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum is the market leader in DeFi ecosystems. It has the largest TVL as well as the most </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/developer-activity-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developer activity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the original, most decentralised and secure smart contract platform, it has the most trust amongst DeFi users. With a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TVL of $69.7B, its dominance stands at almost 65% of the total TVL in DeFi. MakerDao (MKR), built on the Ethereum network, is the largest DeFi project with a current TVL of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $9.5B (8.75% dominance in the DeFi sector ) from a high of $18B at the beginning of 2022. MakerDao is Ethereum&#8217;s largest money market, allowing for lending and borrowing of digital assets. MakerDao is also the protocol behind the most decentralised over-collateralised stablecoin DAI. Ethereum also supports the leading decentralised exchange (DEX) in DeFi, Uniswap, which currently has a TVL of $5.55B and has recently surpassed $1 trillion in transaction volume. Ethereum is the well-established market leader in DeFi it is not as reliant on incentive programs to entice more TVL.</span></p>
<p><b>Key Statistics</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Represents 65% of TVL in Defi. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The network supports the largest DeFi project and money market (MakerDao) and the largest DEX (Uniswap). </span></li>

<p><b>Total Value Locked in Binance Smart Chain </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a layer one blockchain built for easy and secure smart contract applications. Running alongside Binance Chain, BSC is </span><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">meaning that the codes developers use can function and execute smart contracts as they would on Ethereum </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enables developers to develop and use various decentralised applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Binance Smart Chain is currently the second-largest ecosystem for TVL in its DeFi sector &#8211; with a current TVL of $8.6B, making up 8.0% of the total TVL in DeFi. Binance Smart Chain&#8217;s leading protocol is PancakeSwap, a widely trusted DEX that accounts for over 46% of the network&#8217;s TVL. PancakeSwap is currently the second-largest DEX in the entire DeFi space and is a significant reason BSC has had a successful start in decentralised finance. Venus Protocol is BSC&#8217;s largest and most trusted money market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that enables lending, borrowing, and credit on digital assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; TVL of $817.5M. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance also dedicated $1B to growth the Binance Smart Chain in October 2021, with $100M allocated to developing and supporting DeFi protocols. Another clever method Binance utilises to help increase the price of their native token BNB and, in turn, increase TVL is to decrease the supply of BNB every quarter via a token burn. The token burn will stop once the total supply reaches 100,000,000 BNB (currently 163,276,974).</span></p>
<p><b>Key Statistics</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounts for 8.0% of TVL in DeFi. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PancakeSwap is the second-largest DEX in crypto after Uniswap. </span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Total Value Locked in Avalanche</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avalanche is a top tier Proof-of-Stake (PoS) smart contract protocol and is currently ranked #4 for largest TVL. Avalanche&#8217;s native token AVAX has been a top performer in the flagship Ap</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ollo Capital Fund. It now has a TVL of $4.2B and TVL dominance of 3.8% in the DeFi sector. Avalanche allows users or projects who stake their AVAX token to create their own layer one or layer two blockchains validated by subnets (set of validators). This feature allows Avalanche to be compatible with Ethereum, allowing developers to easily port their Ethereum dApps to an independent Avalanche subnet to gain control over its security and function. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum DeFi protocols currently supported by Avalanche include the lending protocol AAVE, Curve and Sushiswap. TraderJoe is the second-largest protocol on Avalanche in terms of TVL ($400M TVL), which is an exclusive DEX to the blockc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hain. The most extensive protocol on Avalanche in terms of TVL is AAVE V3, the ecosystem leading money market used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earn interest in supplying and borrowing digital assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. AAVE is a highly renowned DeFi money market available on layer ones such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Artbitrum, Harmony and layer twos such as Arbitrum and Optimism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Avalanche Foundation DeFi incentive announcement was one of the first major DeFi incentive programs the industry experienced. We can see the TVL that flowed in, confirming it as one of the most successful incentive programs in 2021.</span></p>
<p><b>Key Statistics</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounts for 3.6% of TVL in DeFi. </span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Total Value Locked in Solana </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana is a high speed, low-cost layer one blockchain that supports smart contract interactions for decentralised applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In regards to TVL size, Solana is currently ranked 5th &#8211; with a TVL of $3.8B and TVL dominance of 3.5%. Solanas&#8217;s low transaction costs and scalability solution make it an excellent alternative for those wanting to farm on a chain other than Ethereum. Solana&#8217;s top TVL project is Solend, a trusted money market used for lending and borrowing assets, contributing 13.65% of the TVL on Solana&#8217;s network. Serum (SRM) is Solanas&#8217;s largest DEX in terms of TVL with a value of $292.5M, only slightly ahead of Raydium (RAY) &#8211; TVL $285.4M.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana has success as low-cost and ultra-fast has led to network outages, with the first significant outage occurring for 24 hours in September 2021. The chart shows the adverse reaction of a sharp ~34% decline in TVL to the network being halted for one day. There have since been more outages, which have harmed the ecosystem&#8217;s TVL. </span></p>
<p><b>Key Statistics</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounts for 3.5% of TVL in DeFi. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solend is Solanas&#8217;s leading money market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serum is leading DEX in Solana. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, $3.8B TVL in Solana, reaching an annual high of $11.6B at the start of January 2022. </span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Total Value Locked in Algorand </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algorand is currently one of the smaller up and coming ecosystems in the DeFi sector. It now has a total TVL of $126.9m, accounting for only 0.12% of TVL in DeFi. Algofi is the leading protocol in terms of TVL on Algorand, which is both the top money market and DEX on the network &#8211; current TVL is $82M. Alogrand&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">scalability, high performance and security provide innovative DeFi developers with an excellent opportunity to build the future of DeFi protocols on their blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is interesting to note that even where Algorand lacks in TVL size, it has made up for its consistent TVL growth. This could be attributed to the strategic Borderless Capital fund for Alogrand projects valued at $500M announced in December last year, highlighting the investment interest in projects launching on Algorand. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This investment by Borderless Capital spans across Alogrand&#8217;s largest dApps such as Algofi, Tinyman, Folks Finance and Pact, which are the top 4 applications on Algorand with TVLs between $14M and $84M. </span></p>

<p><b>The Future of Defi for the Remainder of 2022</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there have been recent drawdowns in the total value locked in DeFi, we still see new investors and development enter the space. DeFi is a highly regarded and essential financial service in the digital asset class. During the remainder of 2022, we expect new innovative DeFi projects to enter the space, whilst our favourite blue-chip assets mentioned throughout this article continue to build. TVL values in DeFi will most likely be unpredictable for the remainder of 2022. However, we at Apollo Capital are confident in the continual growth of developer activity in these various DeFi communities. DeFi has had two and a half years to mature into one of the essential verticals in the crypto industry completing. We look forward to investing, utilising and interacting with these protocols and chains moving into subsequent market cycles.</span></p>

<p>The next graph we displayed shows a comparison of the top smart contract ecosystem&#8217;s total developer growth since their inception on the same scale as Ethereum. This graph is another way to visualise the developer&#8217;s activity growth rate and in fact, depicts Polkadot, Solana, Near, Avalanche, and BSC as all having faster initial growth in active developers than Ethereum did. Ethereum still leads the field as of December 2021, with a 280% lead in active monthly developers over its top competitor, Polkadot.</p>

<p>Zooming into the DeFi application level of crypto assets we can observe DeFi had a strong uptick in developer activity over the course of 2021 in the &#8216;blue-chip&#8217; DeFi protocols.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1442 size-full" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3.png" alt="" width="1207" height="541" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3.png 1207w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3-300x134.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3-1024x459.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3-768x344.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1207px) 100vw, 1207px" /></p>
<p>This graph gives the rate of change in the number of total decentralised finance (DeFi) developers from December 2020 to December 2021. Here we see some of the most reputable DeFi protocols, such as Balancer, Synthetix, Uniswap, Lido and Aave, all experience relatively significant increases in their growth in the DeFi sector. Balancer, Synthtix and Uniswap experienced a substantial shift in the number of Defi developers working on their protocols with an increase of over 100% in the one year. Lido and Aave also continued to grow in Defi development with increases of approximately 16% and 13%, respectively.</p>
<p>The developer engagement and its organic growth are some of the most essential fundamental metrics crypto asset investors will use when making investment decisions. The importance of these metrics is heightened in periods of downward and sideways price action in assets across the industry as it is these periods when the market is fearful when fragile ecosystems tend to decline in developer activity, whilst the strongest developer ecosystems remain robust through periods of uncertainty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This article will be covering the events that lead to the de-pegging of Terra&#8217;s (LUNA) native stablecoin UST and, ultimately the sharp and swift devaluation of Terra&#8217;s governance token LUNA of -99.99% over the past three days.</p>
<p>Before deep-diving into the events, it is helpful to understand how Luna and UST operate. UST is an algorithmic stablecoin native to the Terra ecosystem, and LUNA is the native governance token. Both have a symbiotic relationship whereby they operate on a 1:1 redemptions system. UST can be minted by burning the LUNA token, or the LUNA can be redeemed by converting the UST back. Reliance on the market value of the LUNA and UST requires self-reciprocating faith in both the algorithmic stability and the governance token. It is important to note that Terra&#8217;s native borrowing and lending platform, Anchor, has been offering DeFi users a ~20% APY on deposited UST for the past 14 months.</p>
<p><strong>UST De-Pegging</strong></p>
<p>On May 9th, a significant outflow occurred with ~$5B worth of UST withdrawing from Anchor. To get &#8216;out&#8217; of UST in this situation, investors had three options;</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the algorithmic minting function whereby they burn $1 of UST to redeem $1 of LUNA.</li>
<li>Swap out of UST using Curve&#8217;s 3CRV liquidity pool, which had roughly 550M liquidity</li>
<li>Deposit onto a centralised exchange and swap directly</li>
</ol>
<p>With the reserves for the LUNA algorithmic minting function capped at ~300M per day out of the ~2B in total reserves and the 3CRV pool being ~550M in total liquidity, billions of UST were forced onto centralised exchanges to be sold. The tremendous selling pressure caused UST to de-peg significantly, trading at $0.61 on May 10th.</p>
<p>With a significant disparity between the reserves needed to maintain the UST peg outweighed by the billions of UST wanting to exit the ecosystem, UST has not been able to recover its peg after May 9th.</p>

<div></div>
<div>
<p><b>LUNA Capitulation</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of UST de-pegging, traders began using the algorithm as an arbitrage opportunity. This is precisely how the algorithm is intended to function. However, in this instance, it contributed to a significant downward spiral for the price of LUNA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The algorithmic function to assist in stabilising the price of LUNA and UST is built so that arbitragers can sell UST when one unit is worth less than $1 to redeem $1 worth of LUNA, thereby increasing the LUNA supply and diluting the price of LUNA holders. This function works very well during normal market conditions to maintain UST&#8217;s peg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By May 12th, we can see a dramatic acceleration in the supply of LUNA, causing a strong decline in its price. It is worth noting that LUNA&#8217;s supply is infinite under these tokenomics.</span></p>
</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1429 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA-1024x531.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="389" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA-1024x531.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA-768x398.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA-1536x796.jpg 1536w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA-1568x813.jpg 1568w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA.jpg 1848w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Effects on Apollo</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, these events have been felt across all Apollo’s Funds, which has caused a loss of approximately ~5% in both our long funds holding LUNA and ~9% in the market neutral funds holding UST. We are grateful that our risk management framework has contained the losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The events over the last three day can be likened to a &#8220;black swan&#8221; event. Over the past 12 months, the Terra ecosystem has developed into a thriving DeFi ecosystem with significant backing from some of the most reputable institutions and investors in the crypto asset industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Apollo team has reacted by successfully selling the majority of any UST positions at 80c. While this realises a 20% loss on these positions, it has proven to be a prudent trade as UST now trades closer to 0. The Apollo team has sought to de-risk exposure in the market neutral funds and has exited other stablecoins that might carry similar risks to UST.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, we continue to monitor market developments very closely and will keep investors informed.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What struck me when watching the first game of the first round of the AFL season a few weeks back, which incidentally was the 2021 Grand Final rematch between the Western Bulldogs and the Melbourne Demons, was the overt ‘crypto’ presence that was on my TV screen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watching that Grand Final rematch rarely was there a moment during the telecast that crypto didn’t have a visual presence. The jumper sponsor for the Western Bulldogs, CoinSpot – an Australian based Cryptocurrency exchange, was prominent. Crypto.com, a major sponsor of the AFL, could be seen via fence advertising around the stadium and even on billboards on punt road! That major sponsorship deal over five years placed Crypto.com as the Official Cryptocurrency Trading Platform of the AFL and AFLW, worth a reported $25 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Crypto.com is a Singapore based cryptocurrency exchange.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further embedding Crypto into the AFL landscape, AFL CEO Gillan McLachlan revealed the AFL has partnered with Animoca Brands to release NFT’s, non-fungible tokens, in a unique deal that will share revenue with the AFL Players Association. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animoca Brands was once listed on the ASX, now based in Hong Kong, is one of the world&#8217;s leading blockchain gaming NFT studios, worth more than US$5 billion. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During my 12-year professional AFL sporting career with the Hawthorn Hawks, we had many and varied corporate partners. An internet provider, health care provider, car brand and even a State Government just to name a few &#8211; not to mention the obligatory footwear / apparel sponsor. All brands were and still are prevalent corporations within their respective industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin, least of all Crypto Assets, to most during my career, were nothing more than a meme, or perceived fad. Now the services that allow you to buy and trade these assets sit amongst the major sponsors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this new financial world encroaches further into traditional finance, ironically NAB, one of the AFL’s longest standing sponsors, was also advertising around the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discussion around Cryptocurrency has intensified and can no longer be dismissed. The stability and long-term success of crypto assets is some way from being determined, yet the adoption of crypto assets by traditional financial institutions and even nation states, must be acknowledged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonwealth Bank Australia announced in November last year, ‘that it will become Australia’s first bank to offer customers the ability to buy, sell and hold crypto assets, directly through the CommBank app.’</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a few weeks ago, reported in the Australian Financial Review, ANZ ‘has minted a digital asset linked to the value of the Australian dollar,’ otherwise known as a stable coin. Adoption by these financial institutions suggests others will soon follow suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, Crypto.com is making a huge splash to lift their profile. Most notably, via a reported $700 million deal to rename the Staples Centre, home of LeBron James’ LA Lakers, Crypto.com Arena.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto.com has sponsored teams and leagues within soccer, hockey, and mixed martial arts, among a slew of sponsorship deals within the sporting landscape, Further, the platform has also committed to a campaign with Matt Damon – for a reported $100 million. All in an attempt to attract the eyeballs of an ever-growing, affluent youth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s not just Crypto.com ramping up their marketing budget in an attempt to onboard new users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance, the world’s largest Crypto exchange by trading volume, caught the global music industry’s attention when they recently signed a partnership agreement for the 64th GRAMMY Awards. Only a few days prior to that announcement, Binance purchased a $200 million stake in Forbes magazine, also taking  two of the nine seats on their board of directors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Binance.US, the United States partner company, secured $200 million in seed financing at a $4.5 billion pre-money valuation.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst we have mentioned both crypto.com and Binance, when it comes to sponsorship expenditure, FTX must take pole position. FTX, the fastest growing crypto currency exchange over the past three years, now valued at $32 billion, have now partnered with NFL legend Tom Brady and his supermodel wife, Gisele Bundchen. According to the company&#8217;s press release, the couple will work as ambassadors for equity in the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX has also inked deals with the Miami Heat, Major League Baseball and the Mercedes Formula One team, as we saw recently watching the Melbourne Grand Prix. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might ask why these sponsorship examples I have noted are all crypto exchanges? The 2 most significant reasons are that these exchanges are the bridge for the masses to gain crypto exposure. And in doing so, naturally the exchanges take a small clip of those transactions. Furthermore, these are centralised exchanges. Profits are held by the company to then redistribute, in part, to further sponsorship. The examples cited above gives you some indication of the amount of money flowing through these exchanges. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These large sporting brands and identities partnering with Crypto businesses, must first gain an understanding and level of trust in regards to the crypto landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A landscape that is developing quickly, both through a wealth creation, and adoption lens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently when I contacted Western Bulldogs CEO Ameet Bains, he admitted there was some initial trepidation given his lack of understanding of the Crypto industry. He was promptly reassured by his directors and advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial CoinSpot sponsorship deal was extended beyond the 1 year term to now represent 3 years and to further include their AFLW team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, Ameet is most excited about the advancements of blockchain and the opportunity to engage with the Western Bulldogs community via NFT’s and membership deals.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This merger between the new financial world and the old shall catch many off guard. More so, it’s the rate of change that shall surprise most. Given the AFL industry accepted Crypto centric sponsorship dollars for the first time last year, I wonder to what extent does the AFL understand this has the ability to cannibalise and create conflict with one of their longest standing partners, NAB. Perhaps this notion of the inevitability of crypto asset adoption has already been considered. Those who embrace the new asset class, such as the AFL, will have a head start on those who are hesitant. Only time will tell.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Blockchain Australia event a few weeks back, NAB executive, innovation and partnerships Howard Silby, said “banks are starting to have a mainstream blockchain moment”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These comments were made off the back of it being noted that NAB, alongside UBS, Standard Chartered &amp; BNP Paribas among others, has begun developing its own stablecoin to help settle trades on its carbon credit platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given NABs’ sponsorship of the AFL, and the possible collision course of the emerging and traditional financial systems, does that jeopardise the sponsorship money the AFL is set to receive?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, does this merely signal what is happening more broadly within society? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 years ago, crypto to the majority, was a meme. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the largest sporting brands and the highest profiled individuals around the world, are comfortable to partner with Crypto exchanges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this rate of change and adoption, where will crypto sit within our mindset in another 4 years time?</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket Network is quickly establishing itself as a core part of Crypto and Web3 infrastructure. Before Pocket Network, the builders of decentralised applications (dApps) and wallet providers had no choice but to use centralised providers for critical infrastructure services. The infrastructure service that Pocket Network provides can simply be described as ‘fetching real-time data from a blockchain’. DApps, users, and wallet providers can now opt out of using a centralised provider like Infura for this real-time data and instead use Pocket Network’s decentralised network of node operators. The benefits of this decentralised alternative will be explained throughout this post. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Centralisation Problem</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As active investors in crypto assets, we are constantly looking for decentralised solutions to the problems that centralisation can cause. The current sector, Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), has been dominated by a centralised entity called Infura for the past five years and is ripe for disruption. Infura, a subsidiary of the blockchain technology solutions conglomerate ConsenSys, provides developers with the tools and infrastructure to alleviate the burden of running their own ‘data feeding’ tools so that they can instead focus on building their applications. The most popular crypto asset wallet, Metamask, is another product in ConsenSys’ product suite. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Infura has played a vital role in enabling the development and function of DAaps on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms, it has encountered several issues over the past 24 months. These issues include several outages due to the increasing demand for bandwidth across blockchain ecosystems, and their involvement in censoring certain users from accessing their Metamask wallets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2020, Infura lagged behind the rest of the Ethereum node network by not updating to the latest node client and subsequently suffered a significant outage. This shouldn’t have even come close to impacting the wider network; however, because of Infra’s scale and importance, the event </span><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/84232/ethereum-infrastructure-provider-infura-is-down"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caused the Ethereum blockchain to fork</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a result, forked exchanges halted deposits/withdrawals, and the popular wallet, MetaMask, could not be used. While the issue was resolved without any lasting problems, it highlighted some of the issues surrounding Ethereum’s overdependence on large centralised infrastructure services providers such as Infura. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infura and Metamask also came under fire in March of this year when they accidentally blocked Venezuelan users from accessing their digital wallets. The outage of these wallets occurred when Infura changed specific settings too broadly by applying certain geoblocks after the US had announced new sanctions due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The Venezuelan geoblocks were accidentally included in these setting updates leaving many Venezuelan users locked out of their digital wallets. Events like these draw attention to the flaws of a centralised service provider and the tremendous power that Infura possesses in the IaaS market. We believe dAaps and their smart contract builders will elect to utilise products that can offer 100% uptime and censorship-resistant solutions within the IaaS space. These are two features that are core to Pocket Network’s value proposition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Pocket Network Explainer</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket Network is a blockchain data ecosystem for Web3 applications. It is a platform built for applications that use cost effective economies to coordinate and distribute data at scale. Today, the Pocket Network distributes data feeds to numerous dApps across 40 networks, including Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Algorand, and Harmony. These data feeds are vital to the functionality of the dApps. They include any relevant information on a blockchain a certain dApp may require. For example, MyCrypto, a crypto asset wallet provider, will use Pocket Network to retrieve token prices, ticker symbols, contract addresses, gas prices, and other data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket Network’s tokenomics and consensus mechanisms are based on a Proof-of-Stake model, ensuring the data it relays is decentralised, and node operators are sufficiently incentivised. Today it has approximately 40,000+ nodes, which compute an average of 3 billion weekly relays to dApps across 40 networks seamlessly and securely. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Apollo Investment</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the fork caused by Infura in November 2020, we first spoke with Pocket Network Co-Founder and CEO, Michael O’Rourke, in January 2021. At that time, the network had averaged 23.25 million relays each week for the previous month and there were less than 1000 nodes on the network. In contrast, Infura was processing around 2 billion relays/API calls per day. Pocket Network had been quietly in development for over three years before we first spoke to the team. On the surface, it was hard to see the progress made over these 3 years due to the relatively low relays/API calls. However, after digging deeper, it was clear to us that Pocket Network had the potential to really shake up the sector. In February 2021, we proceeded to buy POKT tokens directly from the Pocket Network team for US$0.12 each, subject to a 12-month lock-up. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following our investment, Pocket Network continued to be relatively underutilised and not very well known for a number of months. However, the network started to see increased traction and utilisation in Q4 2021 as the team added support for alternative Layer 1 chains such as Solana, Avalanche, Algorand and </span><a href="https://docs.pokt.network/home/resources/references/supported-blockchains"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the four weeks from 22-2-2022 to 24-3-2022, the Pocket Network averaged 1.738 billion relays per week with 37,820 nodes participating in the network. This represents a 74.75 times increase in weekly relays from 14 months earlier.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the middle of January 2022, the POKT token began trading on popular centralised exchanges; naturally this added to the excitement and hype surrounding the protocol. While the price chart below may not look favourable, the current valuation of POKT is an impressive US$918 million and significantly higher than our US$0.12 entry price. After seeing the network gain a level of traction, we directly purchased an additional tranche of POKT in December 2021 and began setting up staked nodes to increase our support for the network. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1409 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-1024x862.png" alt="" width="750" height="631" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-1024x862.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-300x253.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-768x647.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1.png 1179w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Apollo Node Operations </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operating a Pocket Network node requires a certain amount of POKT to be staked and a reasonable level of maintenance even with automation. In return for operating these nodes, we are rewarded with additional POKT in the form of both inflationary rewards and rewards driven by underlying network activity. Inflationary rewards refers to newly minted POKT; this increases the circulating supply of POKT and can have a negative impact on price if demand remains equal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our nodes currently represent 0.41% of the total network, this strategy is estimated to be generating a variable yield of around 100% APR on our total POKT staked. Apart from the minimum capital requirements, the main barrier to entry for running a node is the actual setting up of the nodes. We have leaned on the expertise of our in-house developer to activate and maintain these nodes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apollo Capital is proud to be supporting the Pocket Network as early investors and node runners. We are strong believers in the power of decentralisation and view Pocket Network as the key piece of the Web3 infrastructure required for blockchains to take another step towards complete decentralisation.   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching Apollo Capital in early 2018, we have kept a keen eye on the correlations between crypto assets and traditional assets. Crypto assets have had a unique path. They are the first asset class that has started with retail participants, slowly working their way up to institutional investors. Almost always, a new asset class will start with the privileged elite, slowly making its way down to retail investors, if ever. This unique path has led to an independence of crypto assets &#8211; they are independent, by their nature, from traditional assets. We have long suggested that this independence should, in theory, lead to a lower correlation in performance. The data has generally backed up this theory, but as is with most matters relating to crypto, it’s an evolving story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We last provided an update on crypto correlations in October 2020. In </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/crypto-correlations-post-coronavirus-panic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we showed that crypto correlations had increased significantly as a result of the March 2020 sell off across almost all asset classes. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto assets and equities are fundamentally different, but their recent correlation is a result of the ‘risk off’ attitude that was prevalent in the weeks following the initial market panic.</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thought it timely to re-run the data with a view to answering the question, do crypto assets correlate with traditional assets?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Data</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In calculating the correlations between crypto assets and traditional assets, we have used the Apollo Capital Fund’s monthly returns since inception on 1 February 2018. For traditional assets, we have used various Vanguard Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. All performance data is calculated in Australian dollars. To our increasingly global audience, we expect the key themes of this data will hold in different currencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If two assets are perfectly correlated, that is, their price action moves perfectly in sync, we can expect a correlation number of 1. If two assets are inversely correlated, that is, their price action moves in the exact opposite direction, we can expect a number of -1. If two assets are not correlated at all, we can expect a number of 0.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, using the same data, Australian Equities have a correlation of 0.79 to International Equities &#8211; they are not perfectly correlated, but they tend to move in tandem.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1392 aligncenter" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table-300x150.png" alt="" width="622" height="311" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table-300x150.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table-768x384.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see from the above table that crypto asset correlations have largely decreased since September 2020. The extra 16 data points (the months between Sep 2020 and Jan 2022) have seen crypto assets correlation to Australian Equities decrease from 0.39 to 0.26. International and US Equities have also decreased. At 0.26, we wouldn’t say that crypto assets are not correlated to Australian Equities, but we’d say they are largely uncorrelated. We could conclude that crypto assets are not correlated to Australian bonds, International Bonds and Gold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this mean that crypto assets are correlating even less to traditional assets? Unfortunately, we don’t think it’s that simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data in the table above is point to point &#8211; encapsulating all performance from 1 February 2018 to 31 January 2022. While we can draw valuable insights from a point to point comparison, it does not tell us anything about what happened along the way. It is also valuable to analyse rolling crypto correlations, how correlations have changed over a period of time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolling Correlations</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolling correlations are calculated by analysing performance data over a given length of time. As new data points become available, older data points drop off. For example, the twelve month rolling correlation on 31 January 2019 will only take into account performance data from 1 February 2018 to 31 January 2019. As we roll forward to 28 February 2019, the February data point in 2018 is discarded and updated with the February data point for 2019. We can perform this analysis for different rolling lengths of time, for example, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. We would expect a smoother result for longer periods of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start with the 24-month rolling period. The Equities Group is fairly smooth. Australian Equities starts at around 0.50 and over the past year has largely stayed around 0.20 &#8211; 0.25.  International Equities and US Equities are fairly consistent around 0.20. The correlation with gold displays a little volatility. Interestingly, the correlation with Bonds goes from reasonably positive to reasonably negative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1398 aligncenter" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3-300x185.png" alt="" width="628" height="387" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3-300x185.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3-1024x633.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3-768x474.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3.png 1533w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the point to point comparison and the 24-month rolling period are interesting, they can often smooth over interesting takeaways. Let’s take a look at the 12-month rolling correlation. (We have removed a number of the asset classes, otherwise it’s very hard to follow).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1394 aligncenter" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-Month-Rolling-Correlations-300x185.png" alt="" width="585" height="361" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-Month-Rolling-Correlations-300x185.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-Month-Rolling-Correlations-768x475.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-Month-Rolling-Correlations.png 786w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focussing on Australian Bonds and Australian Equities, we can see there is a larger degree of volatility in the correlations with crypto assets. Australian Bonds varies significantly, starting negative, before increasing to meaningfully positive, before decreasing to meaningfully negative. Australian Equities also shows a deal of volatility, as correlations increased after March 2020, before decreasing to meaningfully negative in mid 2021 and recently turning positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time we provided an update on correlations we concluded that in a ‘risk off’ environment, crypto assets were not spared. As equity markets began to price in the effects of Covid-19 in March 2020, crypto assets did as well. Equity markets then recovered, as did crypto markets. This appears to have been the case in recent months with interest rate hikes and market concerns over tapering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe there are two key takeaways from this analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Takeaway #1: crypto assets are not a short-term hedge</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To describe crypto assets as a hedge against equity markets is unrealistic. Equally, we don’t think it is appropriate to describe a young technology as a safe haven asset class. It is unrealistic to view crypto assets as a safe haven asset class as well as a technological innovation with enormous upside potential. We believe this description of a safe haven asset class has come about due to the comparison of Bitcoin and Gold going too far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have two strong data points now in March 2020 and in January 2022 clearly showing that crypto markets will not perform well if there is widespread sell off in other asset classes. Perhaps we thought it might be the case a number of years ago due to crypto&#8217;s independent nature, but it would be naive to expect it going forward.</span></p>
<p><strong>Takeaway #2: crypto assets are still largely uncorrelated to traditional assets </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see from both the table above and the 24-month rolling correlation graph that crypto assets, over a long period of time, are still largely uncorrelated to traditional assets. If anything, it appears crypto assets have become less correlated over the last two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between these two takeaways is timeframe. Over a short period of time, especially in a ‘risk off environment&#8217;, crypto assets will likely not perform well and correlation to equities in particular will increase. A simple explanation for this is in the ‘risk off environment:’ investors sell everything, including crypto assets, and move to cash and perhaps gold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over a longer period of time, we clearly demonstrate that crypto correlations are still relatively low. We believe this independence described in the opening paragraph still holds. Crypto assets are still largely independent from traditional assets. We believe an asset class with enormous potential and a low correlation to other assets is worth considering in the overall portfolio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this feeds back into our broader narrative at Apollo Capital: we believe there is a strong argument for a small allocation to crypto assets within the broader portfolio for long-term, patient investors. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Crypto Glossary Terms</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like in traditional finance, there is no shortage of crypto jargon that can make the average crypto newbie feel confused. Today we wanted to help define a few of these crypto native terms to educate readers. Unlike in the movie “The Big Short”, we were unfortunately unable to obtain A-list celebrities to explain these terms in exotic places.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Crypto Finance Terms</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMM &#8211; Automated Market Maker</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMM’s allow digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way by using liquidity pools rather than a &#8216;traditional market of &#8220;asks and bids&#8221;. AMM users supply liquidity pools with crypto assets. Other users can then enter those liquidity pools and swap one asset for another.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridging</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving crypto assets from one blockchain to another. This process usually involves locking the crypto asset on the original chain and then minting the equivalent on the destination chain. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CeFi</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centralised Finance &#8211; Refers to crypto finance that relies on third party intermediaries to function e.g. centralised exchanges and centralised lending platforms like BlockFi &amp; Nexo</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeFi </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralised Finance &#8211; Refers to a subset of crypto projects that aim to build financial applications on top of blockchains using smart contracts </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDP &#8211; Collateralised Debt Position</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CDP is created when an asset is borrowed (on Aave/ Compound) or minted (DAI, MIM) against funds locked in a smart contract. The value of the locked funds must be greater than the debt position.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flippening</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term ‘Flippening’ is given to a crypto asset that surpasses another crypto asset in market capitalisation terms. ‘Flippening’ is most commonly used to anticipate Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin in market capitalisation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas is the common term given to the amount of a native token used on smart contract platforms to buy and sell goods and services. Gas costs can be variable depending on the demand for the smart contract platform. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICO / IDO / IEO</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Initial DEX Offering (IDO) and Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) are names given to public fundraising rounds. They are the final round of raising a project team will perform before releasing their token to the market. ICOs are typically conducted privately with whitelisting of investors, whereas an IEO takes place on a centralised exchange and an IDO, on a permissionless decentralised exchange (DEX).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impermanent Loss (IL)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impermanent loss can occur when providing liquidity to an Automated Market Maker (AMM) due to the constant product function that liquidity pools utilise. As prices fluctuate, the total balance of each asset in the pool also changes, resulting in liquidity providers owning a different balance of coins compared to what they initially deposited. Impermanent loss is when this change in balance results in less returns than what could be achieved if the users just held the assets. It is “impermanent” because IL is mitigated if prices return back to what they were when the assets were deposited. </span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fork occurs when the rules of a blockchain are changed, possibly creating two (or more) distinct digital assets. This may result from an upgrade to the features of the blockchain, a bug in the consensus algorithm, or changes to the node software. Check out our blog post </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/forking-explained/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Forking Explained&#8217;.</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-signature, or multi-sig, is a feature of bitcoin and other digital assets that requires multiple private keys to sign a transaction and move funds. Practically speaking, multi-sig can be used to add an extra layer of security to digital asset transactions by requiring additional approval from a third party before a transaction is approved. Digital asset custodians typically use multi-sig wallets and processes to help secure client funds.</span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nodes are software that run on internet-connected computers and function as non-mining transaction validators and digital asset wallets. In Bitcoin, for example, full nodes download the entire blockchain and validate each transaction per the agreed-upon rules of the network and relay transactions and blocks to others.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rollups</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rollups perform transaction execution outside layer one by “rolling up” or aggregating transactions, and then posting the data to layer one where consensus is reached.

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenomics is the topic of understanding the supply and demand characteristics of crypto assets. Projects will have specific tokenomic designs to drive particular outcomes for their protocol. Circulating market capitalisation, fully diluted market capitalisation, airdrops, seed round fundraising, ICO/IDO and treasury are all items of consideration when designing a tokenomics model. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero-Knowledge Proof</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are an experimental technology that allow one to cryptographically prove a statement, without revealing the input data. For instance, one could prove that a transaction was included in the blockchain without telling you which transaction it is. This technology is currently being used in various layer two projects on Ethereum to enable Ethereum to scale appropriately in the future. </span></li>
