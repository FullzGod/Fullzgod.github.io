										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Crypto-Powered Future is Already Here</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing is essentially an attempt to predict the future by allocating capital to the most promising companies, technologies, or economic models, adjusted for risk tolerance. In December 2003, William Gibson, one of the most influential Cyberpunk authors, wrote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;The future is already here – it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that some people are already doing and experiencing the futuristic things that the larger population will see as commonplace in the near future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crypto-powered, decentralized, and blockchain-enabled future world is already here; it just hasn’t reached everyone yet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Crypto is eating the world, and it’s happening faster than you think</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years ago in August 2011, Internet pioneer and visionary venture capitalist, Marc Andreesen, published a blog in the Wall Street Journal called, </span><a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Software Is Eating the World</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In it, he described how Software and Web companies were disrupting and supplanting many real-world industries and legacy business models, and at the same time dispelled arguments that this was a dangerous bubble similar to the Dot Com era of the late 1990’s. He should know. Marc was a founder of Netscape, which developed the world’s first user-friendly Web browser, and whose IPO in 1995 sparked that boom and launched the beginning of the Internet Age. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eventual ubiquity and inevitably of Software and the Web looks blindingly obvious with the benefit of hindsight, but it was not well understood nor distributed at the time. The same arguments are now being made against Crypto; that it’s an unsustainable and speculative bubble, a niche technology used by a minority of people, and a fad that will be regulated out of existence if it becomes too successful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto combines software with cryptography and decentralized blockchain technology, and is powered by network effects, viral propagation, consensus governance mechanisms, and transparent financial and behavioral incentives. Many industry participants including Alex Mashinsky and Raoul Paul have already observed that ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now eating the world’, disrupting traditional financial markets and even some of the same software business models that Marc wrote about. Unsurprisingly, Andreesen Horowitz was an early </span><a href="https://a16z.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters-nyt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocate of Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2014, and recently raised a second $2.2 billion venture capital fund to invest in this emerging asset class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Apollo Capital, it is our belief that we have already entered a new era (perhaps ‘the Crypto Age’) where large parts of our daily lives – work, social networks, financial capital, human interaction, entertainment, gaming, music, and artistic creativity – will be digitized and increasingly tokenized to be stored and exchanged on a blockchain. These will be overlapping and interacting networks of value that will benefit from Metcalfe’s Law of exponential growth. Few understand that we are in the midst of a revolution in money, finance, and culture that is in the early days of adoption and price discovery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Traditional Finance is the Main Course</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto has found a major product-market fit in the area of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). DeFi is an emerging ecosystem of financial applications and interoperable protocols built on blockchain technology that has begun eating away at the multi-hundred trillion dollar capital markets including borrowing and lending, market-making, store of value, fixed income, derivatives, foreign exchange, payments, remittances, mortgages, asset management, and interest rate swaps, among others – all without a real world financial intermediary. Instead, ‘smart contracts’, written in software code, control the execution of every transaction, removing counterparty risk and the need for a centralized authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a Cambrian explosion of new DeFi projects, and enormous amounts of capital are already flowing into DeFi as the Total Value Locked (TVL) has reached $195 billion, an 830% increase so far this year. Much of the activity is taking place on the Ethereum network, which settles $500 billion of transactions each month and is on pace to settle $8 trillion in 2021, the most in Crypto. ETH, the native token of Ethereum, which generates more than $20 million in daily fees for network miners, is predicted to become a deflationary asset (the total supply decreases over time) starting in 2022 with its migration to a ‘proof of stake’ consensus model. ETH is being described as ‘ultra-sound money’; a potentially superior store of value and a medium of exchange for a wide range of Internet transactions. Compared to Bitcoin’s singular value proposition of an immutable digital store of value, Ethereum, as the original smart contract platform, has many more use cases in DeFi. The Lightning Network is a “Layer 2” scaling protocol that has been in development for years and will enable faster transactions and payments on the Bitcoin network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The innovative economic structures of the future will not be traditional corporations, but rather </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/2021/07/the-era-of-the-dao/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DAOs), operated by volunteer communities of software and capital contributors with democratic and transparent governance policies enacted by proposal voting according to the ownership of protocol tokens. For Crypto projects, DAOs will replace highly regulated legal and hierarchical structures that are controlled by Board of Directors, full-time management teams, and equity shareholders. Driven by open source software, Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), rather than centralized Stock Exchanges, facilitate roughly $60 billion per month of permissionless peer-to-peer trading, creating high liquidity for the vast majority of tokens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another relatively recent innovation, US-dollar pegged stablecoins, have a current market value of $130 billion and enable near instant transfer of value anywhere in the world. Anyone who has tried to wire money overseas (even to an account they own) knows the pain, delay, and limitations of the byzantine and antiquated banking system. In free markets, improved user experience and reduced cost will always prevail over incumbent solutions. The commercialization of the Web has proven this beyond any doubt. Traditional Banks will either soon experience NGMI (“Not Gonna Make It”), or if they want to retain customer deposits, plug directly into DeFi platforms to offer innovative payment and yield products. The leading centralized Crypto exchange, Coinbase, has announced it will allow customers to deposit paychecks directly to their accounts. Shots fired!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>The Web, Culture, and Gaming will be Dessert</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto will infiltrate and permeate just about everything that’s accessible online, and onboard a large new audience to the Crypto asset ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook, with 2.9 billion global users, recently announced it is betting the company’s future on transitioning into a Metaverse company, and is pursuing plans to launch a Crypto stablecoin called Diem. PayPal has integrated Crypto into its global person-to-person and e-commerce payment network. Visa, Mastercard, and Verifone are doing likewise. Reddit, the Web’s largest discussion board platform, launched an Ethereum-based rewards program for community members. Amazon has been rumored to be researching a token strategy. Companies like Microsoft, KFC, The Dallas Mavericks, Norwegian Air, and countless online stores already accept payment in Crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the first Non-Fungible Token was minted on a blockchain in 2014, NFTs (often priced in ETH) really hit the popular zeitgeist in late 2020 with major drops by artists like Beeple and Trevor Jones setting sales records that rivaled the Masters of the traditional fine art world. EtherRocks, Bored Apes, and Crypto Punks are the new ultimate status symbol assets (or “flex”) with collectors now using these unique digital NFTs as online identity avatars. Twitter will soon allow its 350 million users to authenticate their ownership of NFTs on the platform. Jack Dorsey has integrated Bitcoin into both Square, for investment and trading, and Twitter, for tipping and payments. Multi-chain wallets for storing and transacting in Crypto are already integrated into Web browsers and likely soon into Apple Wallet and Google Pay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online gaming is adopting in-game NFTs and has created a ‘Play-To-Earn’ (P2E) business model where players receive tokens and unique items as rewards, based on their skill and achievements. The leading P2E game, Axie Infinity, is on track to generate $1.4 billion in 2021 revenue and has 350,000 daily players, mostly in the Philippines, who are often earning enough to make a living and support their families. Axie’s $35 billion market cap places it in the top five most valuable gaming companies in the world. Using NFTs, cross-game marketplaces, and the blockchain to verify and transport their avatars and items, Crypto game players will interact in an interoperable virtual universe (aka “The Metaverse”). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fashion and music industries will also incorporate NFTs. Dolce &amp; Gabbana recently sold their first NFT collection for $5.65 million. Songs will soon be tokenized so that fans can participate in their ownership and earn royalties from their favorite artists, establishing music as a new form of investment. NFTs will exist at the intersection of culture and finance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking this trend to its logical and fullest expression, we expect the major Social Networks, gaming companies, music streamers, and Web services will integrate Crypto and decentralize their platforms to some degree. The massive global outage of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp is a glaring example of why a decentralized Web is the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Dinero Mágico de Internet</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very few people (other than Jack Mallers from Strike) expected a country to adopt Crypto in 2021, and yet El Salvador, which translates to “The Savior”, made Bitcoin legal tender alongside the almighty US dollar in June. According to President Nayib Bukele</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 million people or nearly half of the 6.4 million Salvadorans are already actively using the state-backed Chivo Bitcoin wallet. That is more accounts than any single bank in the country and likely on track to exceed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banks in the country. Talk about banking the unbanked!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its historical volatility, Bitcoin is the best performing asset of any kind over the last 10 years. Much concern has been expressed over Bitcoin’s power usage and carbon footprint, and perhaps this is warranted, but Bitcoin will have positive benefits as it monetizes the stranded power from legacy utilities and remote renewable sources. Electric utilities in the US are turning to Bitcoin mining to capture off-peak power and for load balancing. Ukraine has formally legalized Crypto and is exploring Bitcoin mining using nuclear power. Laos and Paraguay are legalizing Bitcoin trading and have announced plans to utilize excess hydro-generated power for mining. El Salvador’s state-owned power company will provide mining facilities with cheap, clean geothermal energy, harnessed from the country&#8217;s volcanoes. Understandably, very few people want to live anywhere near a volcano and the lack of a robust electricity grid can make transmitting power to urban centers uneconomical. Bitcoin fixes this. The limitless geothermal energy can be transformed into digital value and transmitted cheaply. Think of this as a store of abundant energy in a digital battery, or even digital gold that can be dug up and transmitted at the speed of light. In doing so, Bitcoin may ultimately hasten the adoption of renewable energy worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare this forward thinking to the United States where the SEC is still dragging its heels on approving any of the 18 Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications on file. It’s only a matter of time, though, and this will be a major step forward to widespread adoption of Crypto, triggering a huge inflow of new capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong><i>Software Disruption Meets the Velocity of Capital</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Crypto, the disruptive forces of software (digital distribution, iterative improvements, and decentralized contribution) combine with the velocity of capital (highly fluid liquidity that seeks yield, removes inefficiencies and intermediaries) to create a powerful, global, and permissionless 24/7 digital free market whose goal is adoption, efficiency, and exchange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are two relentless and insatiable forces that will drive widespread adoption and propagate Crypto through their inherent positive feedback loops across concentric networks of value. Money is becoming programmable, and the definition of and types of money will evolve and their uses will mushroom. Crypto is truly “the future of finance”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto has the incredible advantage of leveraging decades of global Internet and mobile infrastructure investment and adoption that will facilitate its exponential growth. Roughly 48% of the world&#8217;s population, or 3.8 billion people, own a smartphone and can access decentralized browser-based Crypto and DeFi platforms, democratizing financial inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin, and the entire Crypto movement, was born out of the Global Financial Crisis in 2009, and the ongoing debasement of Fiat currencies, negative real yields, and the growing distrust of government and financial institutions have proven powerful accelerants. The “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/O1hCLBTD5RM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money Printer go Brrr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” meme has done more to explain the current Central Bank monetary policy than any Economics textbook. Innovative companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Galaxy Digital have adopted Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset to help solve the ‘</span><a href="https://youtu.be/WrR95PFYDFQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">melting ice cube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ problem of Fiat currency, as Michael Saylor calls it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With BTC at $47,000 and ETH at $3,300, the entire Crypto market is valued at roughly $2.1 trillion, which would rank it between the market caps of Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft. For reference, the global stock markets are valued at $95 trillion, gold at $11 trillion, the broad M2 money supply is another $100 trillion, and outstanding bonds are valued at $130 trillion. With the current trajectory and inertia, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine Crypto’s market cap increasing 3-10x over the next decade. Bullish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>The Final Boss</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the major risks to Crypto&#8217;s success – technology, value proposition, economic model, product-market fit, and consumer and institutional adoption – are well on the way to being solved. What’s left to overcome? Nation State attacks and unreasonable financial regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve already seen a concerted, multi-year attack by China with its “banning of Crypto” (annually since 2013!) and it’s recent total ban on Bitcoin mining, which caused a mass exodus of miners, a broad market panic sell-off, and a significant impact to the network hash rate (a measure of the processing power that secures the Bitcoin network). Impressively, this forced a dramatic decentralization of the network, which is now reassembling itself in more favorable jurisdictions like the US, Canada, Russia, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and Kazakhstan with the </span><a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hash rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already back to mid-May 2021 levels. This is a long-term positive, removes a key vulnerability, and has proven the Bitcoin network’s resilience and antifragility. Is the Law of Unintended Consequences a thing in China?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems the Final Boss for Crypto to defeat is the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission and what form the now certain regulation will take. Our expectation is that regulation will be a long-term positive as the framework will provide legal, tax, and regulatory certainty, and more formally integrate Crypto into the global economy, allowing broad participation from investment funds, retirement accounts, corporate treasuries, and sovereign wealth funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Apollo Capital, we expect significant ongoing market volatility in the short-term, but we are exceptionally confident in the long-term fundamental thesis that Crypto will power the new decentralized financial infrastructure of Web 3.0. The profound and disruptive innovation will continue despite token price fluctuations, and provide an asymmetric return opportunity for investors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Number Go Up</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To adapt a phrase about Software disruption from Marc Andreesen in 2011, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next 10 years, the battles between incumbents and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-powered insurgents will be epic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. However, Crypto will be different; globally inclusive, open source, censorship resistant, spearheaded by decentralized volunteer communities applying their own capital and ingenuity, fueled by memes and a desire to effect real change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward ten years from now, Crypto’s rise will look obvious and inevitable&#8230; just as the dominance of Software and the Web do today.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enormous credit and gratitude to Marc Andreesen, Mike Novogratz, Jack Mallers, Jack Dorsey, Michael Saylor, Elon Musk, President Nayib Bukele, Satoshi Nakamoto, and Vitalik Buterin for their leadership and inspiration. </span></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s blog post will be covering significant events that have occurred over the past week that are accelerating crypto assets&#8217; quest for mainstream adoption. These were the &#8220;B-word&#8221; conference organised by the Crypto Council Of Innovation, news from Fidelity Digital regarding institutional demand for crypto exposure and lastly, announcements of Amazon&#8217;s new hiring remit for hiring blockchain experts in anticipation of setting up payment rails for cryptocurrency payments on the world&#8217;s largest e-commerce platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This chain of events has converged to produce large moves to the upside for crypto assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum jumping 29.70% and 34.60%, respectively, from their weekly lows. While bullish news contributed to the start of the uptick in crypto asset prices, a large volume of ‘Short Interest Liquidations’ on the 27th of July pushed prices to weekly highs. The ‘short squeeze’ was a welcomed surprise for many crypto asset market participants such as Apollo Capital. A summary of the three events is provided below, with their significance on the crypto-asset industry described.</span></p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-527" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-1.19.40-pm-600x340.png" alt="" width="722" height="409" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Institutional Recognition Growing </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Asset&#8217;s mainstream adoption can only be made possible via institutional buy-in. As a result, investment banks and large funds have been slowly building their crypto trading, advisory and research capabilities and offering products to enable other wholesale and institutional investors exposure to digital assets. For example, earlier this month, Bank of America reportedly announced the inception of a new </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bank-of-america-reportedly-establishes-crypto-research-team"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto research team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently, there has been other bullish news for crypto&#8217;s asset recognition among the large institutions. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonytellez/2021/07/23/fidelity-claims-70-of-institutional-investors-want-crypto-but-theres-a-catch/?sh=684e1a0522cc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fidelity Digital has revealed the strong demand for advisors, family offices, pensions, hedge funds, and endowments worldwide to have crypto-asset exposure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their portfolio, with 7/10 confirming this sentiment. Additionally, 9/10 respondents also demonstrated their interest in digital assets by disclosing they expect to have crypto allocations in their clients or institutions portfolios over the next five years. Naturally, these surveys may have a sample bias as they have been inducted via Fidelity Digital Assets and juxtaposed Australia’s institutional investors. The results might tell a different story, however looking back up to 24 months, there is a distinct trend upwards in adoption. Nations are beginning to play a significant role in adoption too, as we know with El Salvador deeming Bitcoin legal tender and countries such as Canada and Europe contributing to adoption via their </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2021/07/23/psst-you-can-get-a-bitcoin-etf-here/?sh=643c66f472e9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF offerings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This trend will continue as larger financial institutions slowly take on more exposure to crypto-assets as they become gentrified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>E-Commerce Giant Enters The Arena</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto tabloids are erupting on the news regarding Amazon and their newly advertised employment request for a &#8216;</span><a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1644513/digital-currency-and-blockchain-product-lead"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Currency and Blockchain Product Lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216; along with 70 other openings for blockchain specialists. The new role is for the payments acceptance and experience team, which will focus on &#8216;owning the vision and strategy for Amazon&#8217;s Digital Currency and Blockchain strategy and product roadmap&#8217;. Since this advertisement has been made public, the market has begun speculating on avenues the tech giant will take towards providing crypto assets as a form of payment, something it does not do today. An unknown source has stated </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/amazon-plans-to-accept-bitcoin-payments-this-year-claims-insider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon claims to begin accepting Bitcoin by Q4 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On top of that, the source also disclosed, &#8220;Amazon is said to be exploring the creation of its Cryptocurrency&#8217;. Supporting this source were the actions Amazon took in 2017 by buying three cryptocurrency web addresses but did not disclose why at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of a corporation developing a native digital currency is not a foreign one and has picked up traction over the past few months. Earlier this month, an article, &#8216;We Were Looking At&#8217;, detailed the Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest in developing a digital currency after a meeting with Jerome Powell and Coinbase Global executives were made publicly available. Another tech giant Apple seems to be following suit with Amazon as they are now advertising for roles of a similar nature, e.g. </span><a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200247094/business-development-manager-alternative-payments?team=MKTG"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Development Manager, Alternative Payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Undoubtedly large tech companies incorporating crypto assets as payment rails and developing infrastructure to support it is a massive bull signal for the industry as a whole.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The B-word Conference: </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market knew they were not finished with seeing Elon Musk on a public stage talking about crypto assets. They were unsure about the angle he would take when asked about the longevity, fundamentals, ESG concerns and personal views on Bitcoin. Elon Musk&#8217;s previous public statements on Bitcoin have been inconsistent. The main event of the B-word conference was a moderated conversation consisting of Square Crypto Lead, Steve Lee, CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, Elon Musk, CEO of Twitter Inc. and Square Inc, Jack Dorsey and CIO of ARK Invest Cathy Wood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall the publicly streamed conversation was a bullish and educational discussion about Bitcoin. Below are some </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-21/bitcoin-jumps-past-32-000-as-musk-says-spacex-owns-token"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highlights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the conversation:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk debunked some myths about his irrational crypto behaviour and perceptions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the main topic of discussion was Bitcoin, Musk highlighted he owns Ethereum and Dogecoin.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk claimed Tesla and SpaceX both have Bitcoin on their balance sheets with no plans to sell.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk claimed Tesla will resume accepting Bitcoin if the network indicates proof of renewable energy usage in 50% of mining activity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dorsey and Musk both had a friendly rapport when discussing Bitcoin. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wood said corporations should consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, partly as a hedge against deflation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference and its positive sentiments for crypto ownership confirm that all three panellists endorse Bitcoin. Looking back on the past week, it is clear the conference was a contributing factor to the Bitcoin’ strong price bounce off $US 30,000, where it has been fluctuating for the past two months.</span></p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Forks</strong></p>
<p class="">Similarly to most successful software products, crypto assets require iterations to the code to:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Fix issues and bugs in code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Add new functionality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Increase performance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="">In software, we see this done via downloadable software updates. In the open-source world of crypto, this is done via a process called &#8216;Forking&#8217;. As ‘Layer One’ crypto assets are primarily decentralised, they require all the active participants in the network that can be referred to as &#8220;nodes&#8221; (miners &amp; validators) to follow the same specific set of rules to function. These sets of regulations combine to be known as the network&#8217;s &#8220;Protocol&#8221;. A Protocol will typically define the following constraints for the blockchain:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Block-size (MBs) on the blockchain that is for mined/validated in the mem pool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The size of the miners’ reward and how it is distributed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The hardware required for running nodes or mining rigs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The mechanism for how consensus in the network is reached (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/">PoW</a>, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">PoS</a>, <a href="http://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/a-brief-introduction-to-hybrid-powpos-consensus-mechanism">Hybrid</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Entitlements for native token holders/participants</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Soft Fork vs Hard Fork</strong></p>
<p class="">As mentioned above, &#8216;Forking&#8217; is a mechanism for updating a &#8216;Layer One&#8217; crypto-asset protocol. It occurs by creating a new chain that is &#8216;branched&#8217; from the original. The branched blockchain is termed the &#8216;Fork&#8217;, and a new protocol will then govern this blockchain. There are two distinct methods. A ‘Layer One’ asset can be forked, either by a &#8220;Hard Fork&#8221; or a &#8220;Soft Fork&#8221;. Details of both are listed below:</p>
<p class="">A &#8216;Soft Fork&#8217; is a change to the network that is &#8216;backwards compatible&#8217;, meaning old nodes that were running before the change will still be able to participate (update to) the new change, as long as they abide by the new subset of rules. If the non-upgraded nodes produce blocks that do not abide by the new set of rules they will not be recognised.</p>

<p class="">A &#8216;Hard Fork&#8217; changes the network so that it is non-compatible with its original network protocol. All un-updated node transactions will not be valid on the new chain rendering it in-computable on the new forked chain until configured properly. A necessary consequence of a hard fork is the duplication of all previous transactions and balances carried onto the new chain. &#8216;Hard Forks&#8217; can be controversial or non-contentious.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Controversial Forks</strong></p>
<p class="">Suppose the &#8216;Hard Fork&#8217; is controversial, meaning the fork results from opposing ideals from developers. In that case, the newly created fork will duplicate all the previous transactions and wallet balances from the original chain. The first block after the fork will now record a brand new version of the crypto asset native to the forked chain. Any developer can fork an open-source blockchain; however, the strength of that fork compared to the original networks will depend on participation from new and existing communities. Two examples of controversial hard forks are; the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork and the Ethereum Classic (ETC) to Ethereum (ETH) fork.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Bitcoin Cash Fork </strong></p>
<p class="">The BCH fork occurred in August 2017 and was due to a subset of developers wanting to increase Bitcoin&#8217;s block size. This change was designed to increase Bitcoin&#8217;s efficiency as a peer to peer currency by allowing more transactions per block. Today 1 BCH is worth 1.45% of a Bitcoin, which is a steep drop from its previous all-time high, which saw a ratio of 26.2% in December of 2017. One of the main causes for the substantial decline is illustrated in our previous blog post ‘<a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2018/11/20/how-the-bitcoin-cash-splitnbspunfolded">How the Bitcoin Cash Split Unfolded</a>’. As most of the Bitcoin community favoured keeping block sizes smaller, Bitcoin Cash is now considered a less successful &#8216;Layer One&#8217; crypto asset to Bitcoin. This sentiment expressed by the community is why we now refer to the most significant crypto-asset globally as a store of value asset, with many coining it as &#8216;Digital Gold&#8217;.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Ethereum Fork </strong></p>
<p class="">Ethereum (ETH) was created due to a hard fork. In this instance, Ethereum Classic (ETC) was not the forked chain but the original Ethereum chain. This fork resulted from the core developers&#8217; response to the original Ethereum being hacked in the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists">&#8216;The DAO Attack&#8217;</a>. Instead of allowing the hackers the $60M in Ether of what was currently the mainchain, they forked the chain off and restored the lost funds to the victims of the attack on the forked chain. The portion of the community that retained the original log of transactions and balances from The DAO hack did not upgrade the software and continues on the original network, Ethereum Classic.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Non-Contentious Hard Fork</strong></p>
<p class="">A &#8216;Non-Contentious Hard Fork&#8217; is designed to implement protocol upgrades. These will likely have been stated on a project&#8217;s roadmap since their inception or, in Ethereum&#8217;s case, after switching the consensus method to Proof of Stake (PoS). A planned hard fork looks to upgrade and enhance the blockchain&#8217;s capabilities and features. As a result, the entire community, spearheaded by the core developers, will transition to the upgraded version of the blockchain.</p>
<p class="">An example of a less contentious hard fork (a minority of miners have been opposed to it) is Ethereum&#8217;s &#8216;London&#8217; due on the 4th of August, block 12965000. The &#8216;London&#8217; fork is part of Ethereum&#8217;s multi-phase upgrade plan as the network progresses to 100% Proof of Work and &#8220;Sharding&#8217; as a scalability solution. Ethereum&#8217;s &#8216;London&#8217; fork will introduce the following five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to the protocol:</p>

<p class="">For the past month and a half, the Bitcoin hash rate has been dropping at an alarming rate as Chinese miners have been forced to shut down operations following a government crackdown. It is widely known that the Chinese government has always had a negative view on crypto trading but the recent focus on mining specifically has been a cause for concern in the country.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Bitcoin Hashrate</strong></p>
<p class="">The chart below from <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate">blockchain.com</a> shows the estimated number of terahashes per second that the Bitcoin network is performing in the last 24 hours. Or simply, the amount of computer power that is dedicated to running the bitcoin consensus algorithm at any one time. From 14 May to 28 June, the hash rate has dropped from 180.66 TH/s to 101.91 TH/s, representing a decline of 43.59%. The hash rate has not been this low since May 2020.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Worst fears realised</strong></p>
<p class="">In early June the investment team at Apollo had the chance to meet a Chinese based financial NFT project who were raising capital. At the end of the call, we asked what the crypto community in China were thinking about the recent comments from the government on crypto mining. The team explained that there was a strong sense of uncertainty and ‘fear’ surrounding the announcement as it was the first time the government had specifically talked about crypto mining. Following last week&#8217;s announcement that the Sichuan regional government ordered hydroelectric power plants to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-cryptocurrency-mining-crackdown-spreads-sichuan-2021-06-19/">shut off power supply to 26 Bitcoin mining operations</a>, it is not surprising that this news sent the market further in the red as the worst fears from the Chinese community were realised.</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class=""><strong>The future of mining</strong></p>
<p class="">Chinese miners are now being forced to move out of the country in an attempt to continue operations, although it is not yet clear where these miners intend to move. It is also likely that a large number of miners will look to sell their mining rigs, pushing down prices for the otherwise in demand computing equipment. While both of these consequences are likely to have a negative impact on the short term attitudes towards the crypto asset market, we think that this dispersion of miners will be positive for the long term decentralisation of the Bitcoin mining network. Bitcoin will survive these Chinese crackdowns and be stronger and more resilient for it.</p>
<p class=""><strong>What are China’s motives?</strong></p>
<p class="">China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), the Digital Yuan, has been under development for several years and is now being <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/china-to-hold-beijing-lottery-for-cbdc-trial">rolled out to the public</a>. China’s nationwide attack on public blockchain crypto assets such as Bitcoin can be seen as an attempt to push citizens towards the Digital Yuan. China is winning the global CBDC ‘race’ and will continue to do all they can to gain the most possible control through adoption of their currency. Bitcoin &amp; Bitcoin mining also presents a threat to the strict capital controls in the country as newly mined Bitcoin can be freely sent to all corners of the globe.</p>

<p class="">When Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, its inflation schedule was hard-coded in the software. It can not be issued beyond what the software specifies.</p>
<p class="">According to Satoshi Nakamoto:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""><em>The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. </em><strong><em>The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust</em></strong><em>. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">When Bitcoin launched in 2009, 50 bitcoins were issued every 10 minutes. That number is cut in half every 210,000 blocks —with 10 minutes between every block, that’s about every 4 years. This is the issuance of Bitcoin since 2009:</p>

<p class="">As we can see, close to 18 million bitcoins have been mined so far. If you look carefully you can also see two points in the history when the graph decreased its slope, in 2012 and in 2016. These points are called <strong>“halvening”</strong> points and marks the supply cuts. We are currently coming to the end of the third period when the supply is cut from 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes to 6.25 bitcoins.</p>
<p class="">It is straightforward to calculate the total number of bitcoins that will ever be mined:</p>

<p class="">Around the year 2140 the last bitcoin will have been mined and we will have the full supply of 21 million.</p>
<p class="">Lately there have been attempts to model this increasing scarcity in what is called the <a href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stock-to-Flow model</a>. For the below modelling we thank the pseudonym Planb, who writes on Twitter under the handle @100trillionUSD.</p>
<p class="">The stock of bitcoin is currently close to 18 million while the flow is around 0.7M per year for a Stock-to-Flow ratio of 25. The hypothesis is the Stock-to-Flow ratio drives value for a store-of-value type commodity like Gold or Bitcoin.</p>

<p class="">In the above chart, the coloured dots are Bitcoin while the grey dot is Silver and the yellow dot is Gold. Bitcoin has so far moved up and to the right as scarcity has increased. Note that the y-axis on the above chart is logarithmic and that the ‘market value’ of Gold is close to US$10tr vs Bitcoin’s current market cap of US$175bn.</p>
<p class="">I mentioned before that we are coming close to the next halvening event. In May 2020 Bitcoin’s supply will be cut in half again. Bitcoin’s inflation can be calculated as the inverse Stock-to-Flow ratio. After May 2020, Bitcoin’s inflation will be around 0.35/18=1.9%. That’s is below the target inflation of the global central banks —and from there it will only go lower.</p>
<p class="">We expect that the market will start pricing that event in closer to the end of this year. We think it’s wise for investors to consider a position as one of the world’s most scarce asset gets even scarcer!</p>

<p class="">President Trump recently shared his thoughts on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. We were unsurprised to learn that he is not a crypto enthusiast. The President’s concern that crypto assets are “based on thin air” is not uncommon. Crypto assets are not backed by anything. But the premise that an asset cannot be valuable if it is not backed by something is short-sighted. Gold, fiat currencies and paintings are all valuable assets not backed by anything. The true determinant of whether something is valuable is the tension between supply and demand for that particular asset.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">First, let’s start with valuing assets. How do we value assets? The simple answer to this age old question is the value of anything comes down to what someone is willing to pay for it. The financial services industry has developed models and techniques to determine the value of a variety of assets. While these models might help determine a range of potential values, the inputs to the models inevitably involve a great deal of subjectivity. (Let’s consider the alternative. If the models didn’t involve subjectivity, everyone would use the same inputs, the models would provide the same answers and asset prices wouldn’t fluctuate). Valuation is art as much as it is science and while these models may help, the true value of an asset comes down to what someone is willing to pay for it. Any other definition can only be theoretical.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">How do we work out what someone is willing to pay for an asset? The answer: markets and the forces of supply and demand. Markets exist to facilitate the trade of assets. Less liquid assets are traded infrequently and price discovery is more difficult. Supply and demand are the forces that drive markets. Supply comes from issuing new assets and from sellers of existing assets. Demand comes from buyers looking to purchase at an attractive price. The value of any asset comes from the ever-present tension between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Markets tell us that crypto assets are valuable. Crypto markets are currently worth around USD$250bn. That’s a lot of value based on thin air! As is the case with every other asset class, supply and demand determines the value of crypto assets. Supply comes from new assets, increasing supply of existing assets and sellers. Demand comes from the increasingly large number of people who are realising the value of crypto assets. The question is not “how are crypto assets worth anything if they’re not backed by anything?” Rather, the pertinent question is “what is it about crypto assets that makes them valuable”? The answer: crypto assets have unique characteristics that are unlike anything else known to mankind.</p>
<p class="">Crypto assets often have the following unique characteristics:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Scarcity &#8211; using Bitcoin as an example, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence. If we think of Bitcoin as money, this is ‘hard’ money. Unlike fiat currencies governed by central banks, it is impossible to print more bitcoin, thereby devaluing all the other bitcoin</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Digital &#8211; crypto assets are digital. The concept of assets in the digital ether is often difficult for people to grasp, they cannot touch or feel it and nor do they receive a share certificate. Native digital assets can be traded digitally with less friction than alternatives. As the world becomes more and more digital, digital assets make sense</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Utility &#8211; crypto assets can be used for a variety of purposes, with different assets suited to different means. People can use Bitcoin as a personal, unseizable bank account, and all they need is a smartphone and internet connection. Crypto assets are often programmable, leading to a number of novel use cases, often disrupting and disintermediating incumbents. The unique economic model of crypto assets means they can capture enormous amounts of value in the process.</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">Let’s compare Bitcoin to gold. Why is gold valuable today? The short answer is because of supply and demand. There is demand for gold because it has always been valuable, because thousands of years ago, a group of people decided that gold has a number of unique properties which meant it would function well as a form of money. Gold is somewhat scarce, so it cannot be duplicated and printed (unlike today’s fiat currencies). Gold is durable, so people can store their wealth with some degree of assurance. It is malleable so it can be shaped into functional coins. Gold is fungible, meaning any piece of gold is replaceable with another piece of gold. Gold, particularly when shaped into a coin, is portable, meaning it can be carried around and exchanged with other people to facilitate trade. Gold became valuable because of these properties. The people of the day decided that gold is valuable and should be valued. This cycle developed further and further until gold was recognised as being valuable, by people all over the world.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">It is important to note that this process did not happen overnight. Imagine presenting a group of people a new asset and proclaiming that it should be immediately valuable. It takes a long time for people to realise the value of a new asset class, as they become familiar with the asset and as network effects develop. Just as gold did not become valuable instantly, nor did crypto assets and nor will they realise their full value for some time.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">If we compare Bitcoin to Gold, Bitcoin’s properties are superior. Bitcoin is more scarce than gold, easier to transfer, more divisible, equally fungible and easier and cheaper to store. On top of this, Bitcoin is programmable and is impossible to seize, unlike gold in the United States in the 1930s which was seized by President Roosevelt. The only advantage gold has over Bitcoin is it’s shiny. In time, more and more people will realise Bitcoin’s superiority to gold, demand will increase and the value of Bitcoin will increase. The estimated market capitalisation of gold is between US$8 and US$10 trillion dollars. Given Bitcoin’s current market capitalisation of around US$170bn, we believe there is a strong case that Bitcoin will capture some of the value from the gold market which is around 50 times larger.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Fiat Currency</strong></p>
<p class="">When we talk about crypto assets as currencies, many compare to fiat currencies (US Dollar, Australian Dollar etc) which is “backed by governments.” I often smirk when I hear  people say the US Dollar is backed by the full faith and strength of the US government. The problem with this argument is this ‘backing’ exists until it doesn’t. Fiat currency is valuable, until it’s not. If macroeconomic problems creep in, people start to doubt the value of the currency. Once doubt creeps in, it can be a slippery slope until the currency is worthless.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Sadly, there is no clearer example of this than the current state in Venezuela. Hyperinflation has recently been reported at 10 million percent and the local Bolivar currency is worthless.</p>

<p class="">Let’s consider a painting by Claude Monet. A Monet painting is not backed by anything other than a canvas. The painting has no intrinsic value. Yet, it is undeniable Monet paintings are valuable. Different paintings by Monet will have different value, depending on the particular beauty of those paintings. And of course, paintings by Monet are scarce. Monet died in 1926, so we know that there will never be any more Monet paintings.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">We can draw a comparison to crypto assets. Crypto assets and rare paintings are backed by nothing, they have no intrinsic value. Yet this does not stop them from being valuable. Investors often ask why crypto assets are valuable if we can simply create new crypto assets. We would say the same about paintings. I can paint a picture of some water lilies at my local pond, but this will likely be no more valuable than any crypto asset I produce. The crypto asset that I create needs to have unique characteristics that are deemed valuable by the broader crypto community, just as my painting needs to be deemed valuable by the art community.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">&#8212;</p>
<p class="">The advantage that gold, fiat currencies and paintings have over crypto assets is they have been recognised as valuable for centuries, even thousands of years. Crypto assets are ten years old. It is highly unlikely that the value in the US Dollar will evaporate over a short period of time. While we think it is also unlikely this will happen in crypto assets, any unravelling of value in crypto assets is more likely than the same for assets which have long been recognised as valuable. In this regard, crypto assets are riskier than the traditional assets discussed, and this is well known and understood.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Crypto assets have unique properties that make them valuable. They are not backed by anything, they might be based on ‘thin air’, but this does not mean they are not valuable.</p>

The 12 forces that Kevin uncovers are inevitable because they are rooted in the nature of technology, not the nature of society. It’s a great read for anyone interested in our future and the big trends ahead of us.</p>

<p class="">I remember reading quite a while ago that one of Google’s design policies for new products was to imagine a world with unlimited bandwidth and ever decreasing cost of computer memory. They knew that technological advances would keep making Internet speeds faster and that, similar to Moore’s law, computer memory would become cheaper and cheaper every year. I.e. by realising the inevitable road ahead they could focus on designing the best products for this future world.</p>
<p class="">In a similar vein, Balaji S. Srinivasan, former CTO at Coinbase, recounts how the Internet was mocked back in 1988:</p>

<p class="">The Onion didn’t see the inevitable future of cheaper bandwidth that 20 years later would make streaming services like Netflix ubiquitous.</p>
<p class="">I’d argue that when Bitcoin was launched in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto had showed the world the inevitable future of non-government based money. This was something that Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman had foreseen 10 years earlier in 1999:</p>

<p class="">With the realisation that money is not something arbitrary that humans choose to adopt but rather that money with the best properties tends to win out over time — Bitcoin’s future looks bright. Fiat currencies have been inflated over time as governments can’t resist printing more. Secondly, security is unprecedented for a decentralised digital system like Bitcoin:</p>

<p class="">Many may dismiss Bitcoin due to things like:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Volatility — Crypto is known for being highly volatile</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Custody — Doesn’t fit into existing custody models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Hard to understand — Crypto is a new paradigm that takes time to grasp</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Poor UX — Crypto is a new technology where UX hasn’t been prioritised</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="">We should ask ourselves are these really things that can’t be overcome with enough time and engineering effort? We won’t get into the details here but we certainly believe that the above issues can and will be solved over time.</p>
<p class="">Just as Bitcoin made non-government money inevitable and unstoppable, Ethereum showed us that smart contracts are inevitable. Smart contracts are contracts executed by software instead to humans. Some of the use cases of smart contract might take a long time to play out and some more exotic versions of the future enabled by smart contracts might never come to fruition.</p>
<p class="">However, what is exciting to us is that you can see a first glimpse of a new, more decentralised world, powered by smart contracts. Early applications include things like Ethereum based <a href="http://compound.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compound</a> where you can borrow and lend in a trust-minimised way:</p>

<p class="">With trust-minimisation we mean that we don’t have to trust the solvency of a financial institution. Compound and many other emerging applications in the Decentralised Finance space are built with smart contracts on Ethereum. While these platforms are still not mainstream, you have to on-board people to Ethereum and in many cases install a browser app like Metamask, having global access to financial services flowing as freely as information on the Internet is a glimpse into a more inclusive financial future.</p>
<p class="">The book The Inevitable lists 12 verbs that will define our future: Becoming, Cognifying, Flowing, Screening, Accessing, Sharing, Filtering, Remixing, Interacting, Tracking, Questioning and Beginning. Thanks to crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, we would propose to add the verb Trust-minimising to the list of inevitable forces that will shape our future.</p>

<p class="">In fact while more and more Gold is found every year, less and less Bitcoin will be mined over time. While we don’t know the amount of Gold in the universe, anyone running the Bitcoin software can verify that no more than 21 million bitcoins will ever be created. This is what we mean when we say Bitcoin is a hard asset, it is hard to create, and it will only get harder.</p>
<p class="">Right now the world is going through a global easing cycle, meaning that as central banks are cutting rates around the globe, more fiat currency is printed. This will likely create an increased demand for hard, scarce assets that can’t be inflated such as Gold, land, real estate and Bitcoin.</p>
<p class="">A record amount of debt is currently trading at negative interest rates. While Albert Einstein has been quoted as saying “the power of compound interest the most powerful force in the universe”, the bond market will have to learn the power of negatively compounding interest.</p>

<p class="">Gold and Bitcoin might be attractive as the world is entering a new wave of global easing as they will never pay a negative interest rate. However, importantly, Bitcoin is also gaining another quality that Gold has — that of being a risk-off asset.</p>
<p class="">I believe there are behavioural learning cycles that the market goes through to find these risk-off assets. Japanese Yen is well known to be a risk-off asset despite Japan having one of the highest (public-)debt levels to GDP in the world. However, every time that there is a flight to safety the Yen will appreciate in value, and because it has done that in the past investors know it is likely to behave the same way next time. This learning pattern after awhile becomes self fulfilling. I believe the same thing is happening to Bitcoin at the moment.</p>
<p class="">This is what happened when President Trump threatened to increase Chinese tariffs last week:</p>

<p class="">A trade war means lower growth, thus the yield on US 10 year government bonds (US10Y) went down. Lower growth means lower demand for oil, thus crude oil (WTI) fell. Stocks, S&amp;P 500 (SPX), fell dramatically. Gold traded up and Bitcoin traded up the most. The Japanese Yen (JPY) is not in the graph above, but the Yen strengthen as well.</p>

<p class="">Bitcoin is a hard asset, in fact much ‘harder’ in terms of scarcity than Gold as the supply has a strict cap at 21 million.</p>

<p class="">More macro driven cycles like the above examples and the market will have taught investors that Bitcoin should be among gold and JPY as a risk-off asset.</p>

<p class="">We believe the global macro climate with easing and a flight to risk-off assets is a good backdrop to being in crypto assets in the short to medium term and wouldn’t be surprised if we wake up to more headlines like the below in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people think of “money”, most think about using it to purchase goods and services. Bitcoin is terrible as a means of payment. It is slow, can be expensive and is not widely accepted. We are often asked, “what you can actually buy with Bitcoin?” The answer is not much.</p>
<p>Crucially though, it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Bitcoin offers little improvement for users when it comes to purchasing coffee and cake. It is easy to underestimate the importance of user experience. Often it is the difference between success and failure. The innovation behind a number of successful technology companies is not necessarily the complexity of the technology, but the improvement it offers to the users’ experience. Amazon originally succeeded as a book seller because it allowed customers to browse, purchase and receive books from the comfort of their lounge chair. Uber offers users a superior customer experience as they order a lift from anywhere, track when it is due to arrive and pay with ease. AirBnb offers users a wider range of accommodation options, often for a lower price than hotels.</p>
<p>Bitcoin does not offer customers a better payments experience. In fact, it is far worse and while it might improve with new technology like the Lightning Network, it is unlikely to be a giant leap forward in payments. The bar for payments is currently very high, by design. Existing payments networks are designed to reduce friction for users. Less friction leads to more payments which leads to more profits for payments networks. Visa’s Paywave allows users to buy their coffee and cake with the tap of a card. Paywave is seemingly everywhere. Apple Pay has improved this again by allowing a simple tap of the phone. Any further improvements are likely to be marginal and are unlikely to come from Bitcoin. Bitcoin is slow, difficult to use and does not improve the customer experience.</p>
<p>Bitcoin might be an improvement for merchants. Using Bitcoin eliminates the risk of fraudulent purchases. Global credit and debit card fraud has been estimated at around US$25bn, a great deal of which is worn by merchants. Bitcoin is a digital bearer asset. Bitcoin can only be spent if the customer is in control of the Bitcoin. There is no room for impersonation. Bitcoin as a means of payment may also result in lower transaction fees to merchants. Credit card issuers charge merchants up to 3% for the privilege of receiving payment. The fees for using the Bitcoin network are typically lower. On the flip side, the Bitcoin network isn’t going to roll itself out to merchants and a middleman is required to build the required infrastructure. Just as Visa and Mastercard charge a healthy commission, it’s safe to assume any middleman will as well. While in theory there might be some improvements to merchants, the customer experience improvements aren’t significant enough to convince customers to absorb the switching costs and start buying their coffee and cake with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>There are two use cases where Bitcoin might flourish as a form of money to make payments. The first is micro transactions. Bitcoin is useful for tiny payments, such as 5c. Credit cards often charge minimum fees per transaction, such as a 30c flagfall, making micro payments impossible. Micro payments could become commonplace for new uses on the web like micro donations or paying for content. Secondly, Bitcoin might flourish for large payments. Transferring $1m to someone else through existing banking infrastructure can be difficult, slow and expensive. Bitcoin happens almost instantly and is relatively cheap. However, the problem of transferring large sums of money is not widespread and Bitcoin’s edge in this regard is unlikely to drive mass adoption.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin struggles as a medium of exchange, many forget that there are other roles of money. There are three roles of money &#8211; a store of value, a medium of exchange (buying coffee and cake) and a unit of account.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin excels as a store of value &#8211; this is where the value of Bitcoin lies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The following highlights four scenarios in which Bitcoin is appealing as a store of value:</p>
<ol data-rte-list="default">
<li>An alternative to gold &#8211; Bitcoin is superior to gold. It is easier to divide, transfer, store and secure. Gold has an estimated market cap of $8 trillion and only a tiny fraction is used (in jewellery for example). It is easy to see Bitcoin competing with gold and capturing some of this value.</li>
<li>Offshore banking &#8211; it is estimated that $15 trillion is stored in offshore bank accounts such as in Switzerland. There are many different motives for storing funds offshore. It is easy to see Bitcoin competing with offshore bank accounts as an alternative place to store value, outside the purview of others.</li>
<li>Investment hedge &#8211; just as many store value in US Dollar or Swiss Francs, many will look to store value in Bitcoin. Storing valuing in Bitcoin is a hedge against macro economic events. Bitcoin is free from association with any country, central bank, political movement or individual. Bitcoin is completely independent and has proven to be uncorrelated to other assets.</li>
<li>In developing economies &#8211; for citizens of countries that are ravaged by inflation and political influence, <a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2019/3/5/crypto-as-a-force-for-good">like Venezuela</a>, Bitcoin is an attractive alternative to storing value compared to local currency. For citizens of developed economies, it is easy to underestimate the value of a digital currency that is independent, permissionless and censorship resistant</li>
</ol>
<p>A common counter argument to Bitcoin as a store of value is volatility. Bitcoin has been highly volatile, which is expected of an asset and technology that is still going through the discovery phase. Bitcoin is only 10 years old. It will take a long time for Bitcoin to be more widely recognised. In the interim, as with any new technology, Bitcoin will be met with both skepticism and enthusiasm. We expect this to continue as the technology and its understanding develops. Gold and fiat currencies have taken a long time to be widely accepted and even today, are at times more volatile than Bitcoin. And volatility works both ways. Just as an investment in Bitcoin may lose value due to volatility, it may increase significantly. Bitcoin clearly has greater potential than gold or fiat currencies.</p>
<p>In most respects, Bitcoin is not a very good form of money. Bitcoin struggles and will continue to struggle as a medium of exchange. People focused on where they can or cannot buy their coffee and cake with Bitcoin miss the point. Bitcoin will continue to break ground as an alternative, superior store of value. Other scenarios to those listed above will likely develop, drawing upon Bitcoin’s groundbreaking properties. There is clearly a large enough market for demand to outweigh supply, as more people learn about and embrace a truly unique form of money.</p>
<p>And if one day it so happens that you can buy a cake with your Bitcoin, well that will be the cherry on top.</p>

<p>As crypto investors we are sometimes faced with the question about the usefulness of crypto. While we believe crypto assets can be the foundation for a new kind of trust infrastructure not just for money but more generally for contracts — we will here think about crypto as a form of money.</p>
<p>Living in Australia or another developed country in Europe or North America it can be hard to understand how important it is not having to trust the whims of the ruling party, a king or a brutal dictator with your money.</p>
<p>Holocaust survivor Ruth Weitz writes in <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Flares-Memory-Stories-Childhood-Holocaust-ebook/dp/B00VOLDI4E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551678940&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Flares+of+Memory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Flares of Memory — Stories of the Childhood during the Holocaust”</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hoping to escape from the concentration camp, I had sewed coins inside the waistband of my dress before going there. Within the hem of my dress I sewed my mother’s engagement ring, and I secured a gold chain inside my long braid of brown hair. I knew the consequences were death if I were caught, but I wanted to be prepared.</p></blockquote>
<p>Imaging if the jews trying to flew the holocaust had a means to protect their wealth by just remembering 12 words or a passphrase instead of hiding gold and risk being caught.</p>
<p>With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that becomes possible, a potential store of wealth which is becoming speech. Uncensorable speech free from political influence, and not possible to confiscate.</p>
<p>A current example of a country where people are really suffering under a brutal regime is Venezuela. Despite being a country with great natural resources its people are now struggling to survive. Due to poor governance, the inflation rate in Venezuela averaged over 32% from 1973 until 2017 before exploding in the last couple of years to over a million percent.</p>

<p>It’s our belief that crypto assets is a new computing platform for trust. Specifically as money it has some important traits that humans have been valuing for millenia. It has the same kind of robustness and scarcity that gold has. We can now for the first time do scarcity in a digital form, going the full circle:</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are not yet private enough to protect us against all adversaries — maybe it most pressuring weakness. Supporting the opposition in a dictatorship using cryptocurrencies is still dangerous if you’re not very technical oriented and even so it is very hard to be sure that your transaction can’t be traced. There is still a lot of work to be done to make digital currencies as trustless, permissionless and as censorship resistant as possible.</p>
<p>Clear, however, is that as a store of value that can’t be seized or deflated by an irresponsible government is, as Carlos Hernandez puts it, “more than a buzzword when you live in a collapsing dictatorship.”</p>
<p>At least when it comes to the digital dimension we finally have an opportunity, thanks to crypto assets, of moving the discussion from “don’t be evil” to “can’t be evil”.</p>
