										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading wealth management industry participant, Apollo Capital has joined the ranks of an elite global group who have been handed the honour of winning a WealthBriefing Award.</p>
<p>Apollo Capital was awarded ‘<strong>Best Digital Assets Offering (South-East Asia)</strong>’ at the <strong>Tenth Annual WealthBriefing Asia Awards 2022</strong>.</p>
<p>Showcasing ‘best of breed’ in the Asia region, the awards have been designed to recognise outstanding organisations grouped by specialism and geography which the prestigious panel of independent judges deemed to have ‘demonstrated innovation and excellence during the last year’.</p>
<p>Each of these categories is highly contested and is subject to a rigorous process before the ultimate winner is selected by the judges. It is this process that makes WealthBriefing awards so prized amongst winners.</p>
<p>The WealthBriefringAsia Awards are part of a global programme run by WealthBriefingAsia and its sister publications WealthBriefing and Family Wealth Report, encompassing all of the world’s major wealth management centres.</p>
<p>Participants around the world recognise that winning awards is particularly important in these challenging times as it gives clients a reassurance in the solidity and sustainability of the winner’s business and operating model.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting on the firm’s triumph, Henrik Andersson, CIO, Apollo Capital said:</strong> &#8220;We are delighted to be recognised in this award from WealthBriefing Asia. We at Apollo Capital have worked incredibly hard since our founding nearly four and half years ago, to stand by our tagline and bring ‘Institutional Asset Management to a New Asset Class.’ We are thrilled to have received this award, in recognition of our efforts and strong performance delivered to investors. Since expanding to Singapore nearly 12 months ago, we have been delighted with the reception from the Asian markets and continue to be impressed by their enthusiasm to learn about and invest in crypto assets.”</p>
<p><strong>ClearView Financial Media’s CEO, and Publisher of WealthBriefing, Stephen Harris, was the first to extend his congratulations to all the winners. He said:</strong> “The organisations and individuals who triumphed in these awards are all worthy winners, and I would like to extend my heartiest congratulations to the winners and to those who have put so much work into each winning submission.</p>
<p>“It is clear that the judges valued and recognised Apollo Capital’s strong performance and approach to investing in crypto assets. These awards were independently and expertly judged solely on the basis of entrants’ submissions and their responses to a number of specific questions, which were answered by focusing on the client experience rather than purely quantitative performance metrics. That is unique, and I believe, compelling feature. These awards recognise the very best operators in Asia wealth management, with ‘independence’, ‘integrity’ and ‘genuine insight’ the watchwords of the judging process &#8211; such that the awards truly reflect excellence in Asia wealth management.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s article will build on our previous article, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span></i><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/defi-tvl-boom/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeFi Total Value Locked Boom</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from September 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have witnessed considerable change in the global macroeconomic environment and crypto ecosystem during this time. These broader changes have harmed DeFi TVL. However, the fundamentals of what makes a strong DeFi ecosystem in the long term have not varied.</span></p>
<p><b>Fundamentals of Strong DeFi Ecosystems</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few key fundamentals contribute to an ecosystem&#8217;s strength and success in the DeFi sector. The first attribute of a vibrant DeFi ecosystem is a Decentralised Exchange (DEX) with high liquidity and high Total Value Locked (TVL). Traditionally successful DEXs will also have native tokens to incentivise liquidity. The largest DEXs in the market today are Uniswap and Curve. These protocols incentivise users to provide the automated market maker with liquidity for transaction fees and tokens &#8211; a current strategy we implement in our ACOF is allocating capital to the </span><a href="https://curve.fi/musd/deposit">Curve mUSD pool</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to earn an annual yield of 7.84%. For an in-depth description and demo of how DEXs operate, please refer to our </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHxgK2gDzcs&amp;t=3s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;DeFi Explained&#8217;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video covering the DEX SushiSwap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second ingredient to a thriving DeFi blockchain is to have strong, decentralised money markets (borrowing and lending protocols) that are trustworthy and reliable. Trust and reliability are commonly measured in the TVL the platforms can garner. Users feel more comfortable interacting and depositing capital into protocols that have become battle-hardened through time in the market and those that have undergone excessive code audits. Protocols that hit this profile are Aave and Compound. They are considered the most trusted protocols in this DeFi category and span multiple blockchains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last fundamental contributor to a flourishing DeFi ecosystem is the incentive programs and strategic marketing. Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche are all crypto assets held by Apollo Capital and have had their growth catalysed by large scale incentive programs targeting both developers and users. These incentive programs allocate the blockchain&#8217;s native token to protocols and yield farmers to promote TVL growth and development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we can see Avalanche is running an incentive program on one of the largest and most trusted money market protocols, AAVE. In addition, the interest in the token a DeFi user can earn supplying it. The user can also earn wrapped AVAX as a reward for utilising the AAVE.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1467 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--1024x645.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="472" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--1024x645.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--768x484.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--1536x968.jpg 1536w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--1568x988.jpg 1568w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example-.jpg 1696w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without well-established decentralised exchanges and money market protocols, blockchains will naturally have a lower TVL than other ecosystems. Algorand is another asset held by Apollo Capital with a relatively low TVL compared to another layer one chain with its decentralised money market, AlgoFi and decentralised exchange Tinyman, both still in their infancy. However, smaller ecosystems in the top 100 crypto assets such as Alogrand have the potential to increase if their dApps gain traction and strategic liquidity incentives are initiated. Ecosystems such as Solana, Avalanche and Polygon covered in this article make fantastic examples of TVL growth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Current TVL in Crypto 2022</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TVL in decentralised finance (DeFi) is currently at its lowest point in 2022. TVL has dropped from over $240B in January to around $107.6B today (-55%). This decline is due to crypto and macroeconomic factors. Luna&#8217;s failure has brought the public&#8217;s attention to DeFi. The world witnessed a $30B TVL loss in Luna&#8217;s ecosystem and represented a large proportion of TVL in DeFi. This recent event has shaken the whole DeFi sector, so we have seen recent reductions in TVL of most layer one ecosystems. Decreasing token price locked up contributes to a decrease in TVL, and the crypto market&#8217;s current correlation to the broader equities markets has also been another contributor. By the end of April 2022, the S&amp;P 500 recorded a loss of 13.8%, its worst start to the year since World War II. This negative sentiment generated from the federal reserve rate hikes and global supply constraints flowed into DeFi asset valuations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This graph illustrates the adoption of DeFi before the onset of adverse macroeconomic factors at the beginning of 2022 and the collapse of Luna (Terra) in early May 2022. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Total Value Locked in Ethereum</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum is the market leader in DeFi ecosystems. It has the largest TVL as well as the most </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/developer-activity-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developer activity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the original, most decentralised and secure smart contract platform, it has the most trust amongst DeFi users. With a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TVL of $69.7B, its dominance stands at almost 65% of the total TVL in DeFi. MakerDao (MKR), built on the Ethereum network, is the largest DeFi project with a current TVL of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $9.5B (8.75% dominance in the DeFi sector ) from a high of $18B at the beginning of 2022. MakerDao is Ethereum&#8217;s largest money market, allowing for lending and borrowing of digital assets. MakerDao is also the protocol behind the most decentralised over-collateralised stablecoin DAI. Ethereum also supports the leading decentralised exchange (DEX) in DeFi, Uniswap, which currently has a TVL of $5.55B and has recently surpassed $1 trillion in transaction volume. Ethereum is the well-established market leader in DeFi it is not as reliant on incentive programs to entice more TVL.</span></p>
<p><b>Key Statistics</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Represents 65% of TVL in Defi. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The network supports the largest DeFi project and money market (MakerDao) and the largest DEX (Uniswap). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, $69.7B TVL in Ethereum, reaching an annual high of $150B at the start of January 2022. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1459" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ethereum-Ecosystem.jpg" alt="" width="852" height="415" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ethereum-Ecosystem.jpg 852w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ethereum-Ecosystem-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ethereum-Ecosystem-768x374.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Total Value Locked in Binance Smart Chain </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a layer one blockchain built for easy and secure smart contract applications. Running alongside Binance Chain, BSC is </span><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">meaning that the codes developers use can function and execute smart contracts as they would on Ethereum </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enables developers to develop and use various decentralised applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Binance Smart Chain is currently the second-largest ecosystem for TVL in its DeFi sector &#8211; with a current TVL of $8.6B, making up 8.0% of the total TVL in DeFi. Binance Smart Chain&#8217;s leading protocol is PancakeSwap, a widely trusted DEX that accounts for over 46% of the network&#8217;s TVL. PancakeSwap is currently the second-largest DEX in the entire DeFi space and is a significant reason BSC has had a successful start in decentralised finance. Venus Protocol is BSC&#8217;s largest and most trusted money market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that enables lending, borrowing, and credit on digital assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; TVL of $817.5M. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance also dedicated $1B to growth the Binance Smart Chain in October 2021, with $100M allocated to developing and supporting DeFi protocols. Another clever method Binance utilises to help increase the price of their native token BNB and, in turn, increase TVL is to decrease the supply of BNB every quarter via a token burn. The token burn will stop once the total supply reaches 100,000,000 BNB (currently 163,276,974).</span></p>
<p><b>Key Statistics</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounts for 8.0% of TVL in DeFi. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PancakeSwap is the second-largest DEX in crypto after Uniswap. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venus Protocol (XVS) is BSC&#8217;s largest money market. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, $8.6B TVL in Solana, reaching an annual high of $17.4B at the beginning of January 2022. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significant amounts of BNB are removed (burnt) each quarter. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1458" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Binance-Ecosystem-.jpg" alt="" width="849" height="431" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Binance-Ecosystem-.jpg 849w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Binance-Ecosystem--300x152.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Binance-Ecosystem--768x390.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Total Value Locked in Avalanche</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avalanche is a top tier Proof-of-Stake (PoS) smart contract protocol and is currently ranked #4 for largest TVL. Avalanche&#8217;s native token AVAX has been a top performer in the flagship Ap</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ollo Capital Fund. It now has a TVL of $4.2B and TVL dominance of 3.8% in the DeFi sector. Avalanche allows users or projects who stake their AVAX token to create their own layer one or layer two blockchains validated by subnets (set of validators). This feature allows Avalanche to be compatible with Ethereum, allowing developers to easily port their Ethereum dApps to an independent Avalanche subnet to gain control over its security and function. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum DeFi protocols currently supported by Avalanche include the lending protocol AAVE, Curve and Sushiswap. TraderJoe is the second-largest protocol on Avalanche in terms of TVL ($400M TVL), which is an exclusive DEX to the blockc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hain. The most extensive protocol on Avalanche in terms of TVL is AAVE V3, the ecosystem leading money market used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earn interest in supplying and borrowing digital assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. AAVE is a highly renowned DeFi money market available on layer ones such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Artbitrum, Harmony and layer twos such as Arbitrum and Optimism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Avalanche Foundation DeFi incentive announcement was one of the first major DeFi incentive programs the industry experienced. We can see the TVL that flowed in, confirming it as one of the most successful incentive programs in 2021.</span></p>
<p><b>Key Statistics</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounts for 3.6% of TVL in DeFi. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compatible with Ethereum dApps through unique subnet integration. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, $3.9B TVL in Avalanche, reaching an annual high of $11.7B at the start of January 2022. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large fund allocations from Avalanche Foundation for DeFi incentives and subnet growth.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1455" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Avax-Ecosystem.jpg" alt="" width="691" height="422" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Avax-Ecosystem.jpg 691w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Avax-Ecosystem-300x183.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Total Value Locked in Solana </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana is a high speed, low-cost layer one blockchain that supports smart contract interactions for decentralised applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In regards to TVL size, Solana is currently ranked 5th &#8211; with a TVL of $3.8B and TVL dominance of 3.5%. Solanas&#8217;s low transaction costs and scalability solution make it an excellent alternative for those wanting to farm on a chain other than Ethereum. Solana&#8217;s top TVL project is Solend, a trusted money market used for lending and borrowing assets, contributing 13.65% of the TVL on Solana&#8217;s network. Serum (SRM) is Solanas&#8217;s largest DEX in terms of TVL with a value of $292.5M, only slightly ahead of Raydium (RAY) &#8211; TVL $285.4M.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana has success as low-cost and ultra-fast has led to network outages, with the first significant outage occurring for 24 hours in September 2021. The chart shows the adverse reaction of a sharp ~34% decline in TVL to the network being halted for one day. There have since been more outages, which have harmed the ecosystem&#8217;s TVL. </span></p>
<p><b>Key Statistics</b></p>

<p><b>Total Value Locked in Algorand </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algorand is currently one of the smaller up and coming ecosystems in the DeFi sector. It now has a total TVL of $126.9m, accounting for only 0.12% of TVL in DeFi. Algofi is the leading protocol in terms of TVL on Algorand, which is both the top money market and DEX on the network &#8211; current TVL is $82M. Alogrand&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">scalability, high performance and security provide innovative DeFi developers with an excellent opportunity to build the future of DeFi protocols on their blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is interesting to note that even where Algorand lacks in TVL size, it has made up for its consistent TVL growth. This could be attributed to the strategic Borderless Capital fund for Alogrand projects valued at $500M announced in December last year, highlighting the investment interest in projects launching on Algorand. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This investment by Borderless Capital spans across Alogrand&#8217;s largest dApps such as Algofi, Tinyman, Folks Finance and Pact, which are the top 4 applications on Algorand with TVLs between $14M and $84M. </span></p>

<p><b>The Future of Defi for the Remainder of 2022</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there have been recent drawdowns in the total value locked in DeFi, we still see new investors and development enter the space. DeFi is a highly regarded and essential financial service in the digital asset class. During the remainder of 2022, we expect new innovative DeFi projects to enter the space, whilst our favourite blue-chip assets mentioned throughout this article continue to build. TVL values in DeFi will most likely be unpredictable for the remainder of 2022. However, we at Apollo Capital are confident in the continual growth of developer activity in these various DeFi communities. DeFi has had two and a half years to mature into one of the essential verticals in the crypto industry completing. We look forward to investing, utilising and interacting with these protocols and chains moving into subsequent market cycles.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This article will cover developer activity&#8217;s fastest and largest growing smart contract ecosystems. Apollo Capital uses these metrics to help understand which ecosystems are the most collaborative, vibrant and committed to building long-lasting blockchains that can withstand the various crypto market cycles and external macroeconomic factors. </span></p>
<p>Below are the five largest smart contract platforms by total developers and a summary of their metrics. The y-axis indicates the average monthly Full-Time developers in 2021 and the x-axis indicates the average monthly Full-Time developers in 2020. All five of the largest ecosystems grew over the course of 2021.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1436 size-full" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222.png" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222.png 2000w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222-300x169.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222-768x432.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222-1568x882.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum (ETH)</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum is the number one blockchain when looking into layer one developer activity. The network enables users and developers to interact with smart contracts, digital assets and decentralised finance applications. It is currently the leading chain regarding non-fungible token (NFT) volume and TVL in its decentralised finance sector. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over 4000 total monthly active developers</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Frontier for development in defi </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">42% increase of total monthly active developers from December 2020 to December 2021</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Polkadot (DOT)</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Polkadot is the second-largest layer one blockchain in regards to development activity. The network provides high energy efficiency, economic scalability, and an innovative opportunity for their parachain developers to gain complete control over the underlying blockchain instead of only via smart contracts. This unique feature allows for a more secure, faster and enhanced service across the entire ecosystem.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Approximately 1400 total monthly active developers</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">50% increase of total monthly active developers from December 2020 to December 2021</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solana (SOL)</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solana is a high speed, low-cost layer one blockchain that supports smart contract interactions for decentralised applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Solana&#8217;s security and scalability solution ensures the chain is censorship-resistant and transactions never exceed $0.01 per transaction. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Approximately 1000 total monthly active developers</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">385% increase of total monthly active developers from December 2020 to December 2021</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cosmos (ATOM) </span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cosmos is a decentralised ecosystem of blockchains with its solutions to problems, including scalability, usability and interoperability. The network makes blockchain development easy and powerful with high application scalability through its horizontal and vertical scalability solutions. Cosmos aims to break barriers between blockchains and allow them to communicate with each other in a decentralised way. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Approximately 1000 total monthly active developers</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">70% increase of total monthly active developers from December 2020 to December 2021</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bitcoin (BTC)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that uses peer to peer technology to eliminate central control. Bitcoin’s network is open-sourced and is used as a unique payment network with fast peer-to-peer transactions, low processing fees and security.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 650 <span data-preserver-spaces="true"> total monthly active developers</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10% <span data-preserver-spaces="true">increase of total monthly active developers from December 2020 to December 2021</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>The next graph we displayed shows a comparison of the top smart contract ecosystem&#8217;s total developer growth since their inception on the same scale as Ethereum. This graph is another way to visualise the developer&#8217;s activity growth rate and in fact, depicts Polkadot, Solana, Near, Avalanche, and BSC as all having faster initial growth in active developers than Ethereum did. Ethereum still leads the field as of December 2021, with a 280% lead in active monthly developers over its top competitor, Polkadot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zooming into the DeFi application level of crypto assets we can observe DeFi had a strong uptick in developer activity over the course of 2021 in the &#8216;blue-chip&#8217; DeFi protocols.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1442 size-full" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3.png" alt="" width="1207" height="541" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3.png 1207w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3-300x134.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3-1024x459.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3-768x344.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1207px) 100vw, 1207px" /></p>
<p>This graph gives the rate of change in the number of total decentralised finance (DeFi) developers from December 2020 to December 2021. Here we see some of the most reputable DeFi protocols, such as Balancer, Synthetix, Uniswap, Lido and Aave, all experience relatively significant increases in their growth in the DeFi sector. Balancer, Synthtix and Uniswap experienced a substantial shift in the number of Defi developers working on their protocols with an increase of over 100% in the one year. Lido and Aave also continued to grow in Defi development with increases of approximately 16% and 13%, respectively.</p>
<p>The developer engagement and its organic growth are some of the most essential fundamental metrics crypto asset investors will use when making investment decisions. The importance of these metrics is heightened in periods of downward and sideways price action in assets across the industry as it is these periods when the market is fearful when fragile ecosystems tend to decline in developer activity, whilst the strongest developer ecosystems remain robust through periods of uncertainty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2021 was an incredible year for crypto with new all time highs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as many other assets. We also saw corporations and institutions support crypto like never before. The first Bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US and here in Australia we saw the country’s largest bank, CBA start offering crypto assets to their clients. If 2020 was the year of DeFi, 2021 saw a boom in the NFT market.</p>
<p>It’s incredibly hard to predict what will happen in the fast moving crypto markets, but here are my best bets for 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling</strong></p>
<p>2022 will be the year of scaling Ethereum. Together with alternative Layer 1s, my prediction is that Ethereum Layer 1 will become less than 50% of total DeFi TVL in 2022. By the end of 2022, the majority of TVL will be on Ethereum Layer 2s and alternative L1s. This would be a huge shift in the market, accelerated by the launch of L2 tokens on Arbitrum and Optimism. For the first time blockchains will be able to onboard 100s of millions of users.</p>
<p><strong>DeFi/Derivatives</strong></p>
<p>While the general market rallied in 2021, a surprising number of DeFi assets underperformed, some even posting negative fiat denominated returns for the full year. I think we will see a resurgence in DeFi assets in 2022 partly helped by scaling that will enable things like on-chain derivatives to a much larger extent. My prediction is for $1 trillion in DeFi TVL by the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Chain</strong></p>
<p>2021 was the year that cemented the thesis that we are moving into a multi-chain world. Infrastructure projects enabling this future, things like multi-chain DEXes and bridges will significantly increase in a value in 2022. My prediction is that we will see at least one of these multi-chain infrastructure projects enter the top 20 most valuable crypto assets.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Headwinds</strong></p>
<p>We didn’t see much regulatory developments in 2021. Perhaps the biggest development was the approval of the first Bitcoin ETF in the US (unfortunately futures based). My prediction is that we will see negative regulatory developments out of the US in 2022. Influential senators like Elizabeth Warren (who eg Ryan Selkis of Messari refers to as Satan) has recently expressed deeply flawed and negative bias against crypto. My hope is that any negative development out of the US will not spill over to the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Web3/Metaverse</strong></p>
<p>A mega-trend in 2021 was NFTs going mainstream. Currently, NFT are mostly used for art, collectibles and for in-game items. All these ares will continue to grow rapidly. Another potentially huge growth area of NFTs is the metaverse. My prediction is that we will see another mega corporation, the likes of a Google or Apple, follow Meta (formerly Facebook) and launch products/services to support metaverse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2021 Predictions Review </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>1</em></strong><em>. We will see the rise of Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. While there has been much talk about Ethereum 2.0, it is still years away in the sense of being useable for smart contracts. I believe we will see some big DeFi protocols move to L2 in 2021 accompanied by real volumes. I hope that the community will come to a consensus over which solution to use, be it Optimistic Rollups or something else, but that is probably wishing for too much.</em></p>
<p>We did see the launch of Ethereum L2s with support from mainstream protocols like Uniswap, Balancer, Synthetix etc. However we didn’t see significant TVL or usage on these L2 in 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.</strong> Coinbase will IPO on a major exchange such as the NYSE or Nasdaq. This event would bring a lot of attention to crypto and solidify Coinbase as the ‘Google’ (or is it IBM?) of crypto.</em></p>
<p>Coinbase did IPO in April of 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. </strong>Bitcoin will again see an all time high in 2021. My personal opinion is that Bitcoin could reach US$50,000-100,000 in this bull cycle. I believe this could happen in 2021.  Monetary policy will continue to pour cash into global economies throughout 2021 while the supply increase of Bitcoin has decreased to only 6.25 BTC per block or 1.7% supply inflation per year. This is a potent cocktail for the best performing asset in the world to continue to outperform.</em></p>
<p>This was spot on as Bitcoin hit an all time high above $68,000 in November of 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. </strong>We will see the rise of at least one trustless stablecoin. With trustless I mean a crypto backed stablecoin or an algorithmic stablecoin. I bet one of them will reach over 500M in market cap in 2021. </em></p>
<p>2021 was a huge year for trustless stablecoins. TerraUSD got 10bn in market cap, MIM 4.5 bn, Frax 1.9bn, Liquity USD 833M and Fei USD 762M. At Apollo, we continue to be mega-bullish trustless stablecoins.</p>
<p><em><strong>5.</strong> Finally, I predict Cardano will fall out of top 10 crypto assets as defined by Coingecko. While Cardano is a far superior crypto asset to a lot of other assets out there, the top 10 is still very inefficient and will continue to change dramatically over time. In the case of Layer 1 smart contract platforms, the competition is getting very intense and I’d be surprised if Cardano will stay in its current position.</em></p>
<p>Cardano didn’t fall out of top 10, currently sitting at spot number 7. According to DeFiLlama Cardano has the highest market cap to TVL of any blockchain. I think market cap will go down faster than they will gain TVL.</p>

<p>对加密货币而言，2021年是不可思议的一年。比特币、以太坊及许多其他加密资产的价格都创下历史新高。我们还看到，企业和机构在前所未有地支持加密货币。第一个比特币相关的ETF在美国获得批准，并且澳大利亚最大的银行CBA开始向客户提供加密资产服务。如果说2020年是DeFi之年，那么2021年则见证了NFT市场的繁荣。</p>
<p>虽然很难预测瞬息万变的加密市场将会发生什么，但我还是尽我所能对2022年做出预测。</p>
<p><strong>扩展性</strong><br />
2022年将是以太坊扩展性大为发展的一年。我认为，在2022年，以太坊Layer 1在DeFi 上的总锁定价值（TVL）将降至50%以下。到2022年底，大部分TVL将会基于以太坊的Layer 2链和其他Layer 1 区块链。这将是市场的巨大转变，并且在Arbitrum和Optimism上推出Layer 2代币，会进一步推动这种变化。区块链也将首次搭载上亿用户。</p>
<p><strong>DeFi/衍生品</strong><br />
尽管整个加密市场在2021年上行，但大量DeFi资产的表现不及预期，甚至一些资产全年的法币计价回报表现为负收益。我认为，我们将在2022年看到DeFi资产的复苏，这在一定程度上得益于以太坊的扩展性，而扩展性将使链上衍生品等DeFi应用在更大程度上得以落地。</p>
<p>我的预测是，到今年年底，DeFi TVL将达到1万亿美元。</p>
<p><strong>多链</strong><br />
2021年论证了我们正进入多链世界的这一观点。而实现多链的基础设施项目，如多链DEX（去中心化交易所）和跨链桥等项目的价值将在2022年显著上升。</p>
<p>我的预测是，至少有一个多链基础设施项目将位列最具价值的20个加密资产。</p>
<p><strong>监管的不利因素</strong><br />
在2021年，监管方面并无显著进展。或许最大的进展便是，美国首支比特币相关ETF获批。但遗憾的是，这只是比特币期货的ETF，而不是真正的比特币ETF。</p>
<p>我的预测是，美国对加密资产的监管在2022年会更加苛刻。Elizabeth Warren等有影响力的参议员最近表达了对加密货币的偏见及不认可。我希望，美国的任何负面政策将来不会波及到世界其他地区。</p>
<p><strong>Web 3/元宇宙</strong><br />
NFT走向主流世界，这是2021年的一大趋势。目前，NFT主要用于艺术品、收藏品和游戏道具。所有这些领域将继续迅速发展。而NFT的另一个潜在的巨大增长领域则是元宇宙。</p>
<p>我的预测是，我们将看到另一家巨头企业（如谷歌或苹果等）会追随Meta（即脸书）的脚步，推出支持Meta的产品或服务。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>2021 Predictions Review</strong><br />
回顾2021年的预测，准确率高达 80%</p>
<p><strong>预测1：</strong>我们将看到以太坊Layer 2解决方案的崛起。虽然关于以太坊2.0的讨论已经很多了，但要真正用于智能合约的平台，还需要几年的时间。</p>
<p>我相信，在2021年，一些大型DeFi协议将迁移到多个Layer 2链上，并拥有真正的用户流量。我希望加密社区能够就使用哪种解决方案达成共识，如Optimistic Rollups抑或是其他，但我的期望可能太高了。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>在2021年，我们确实看到了在主流协议如Uniswap、Balancer、Synthetix等的支持下，多个以太坊Layer 2链面世了。然而，Layer 2链并未拥有大量的TVL，而且这些协议也没有应用在Layer 2上。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测2</strong>：Coinbase将在纽交所或纳斯达克等主流交易所上市。这一事件将引起人们对加密货币的大量关注，也将巩固Coinbase作为加密货币领域“谷歌”或“IBM”的地位。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>Coinbase的确于2021年4月份上市。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测3：</strong>比特币将在2021年再次创下历史新高。我个人认为，在这个牛市周期中，比特币价格可能达到5 -10万美元。我相信这可能会在2021年实现。2021年全年，货币政策将继续印钞，用以刺激全球经济。而比特币供应量的增幅已降至每区块6.25 BTC，或者说其每年的供应通胀仅为1.7%。这是世界上表现最好的资产，并将继续跑赢大盘。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>比特币在2021年11月突破68000美元关口，创下历史新高。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测4：</strong>我们将看到至少一种无需信任的稳定币的崛起。我指的是加密货币支持的稳定币或算法稳定币。我敢打赌，到2021年，其中一家公司的市值将超过5亿美元。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>2021年对稳定币来说是重要的一年。TerraUSD的市值为100亿美元，MIM为45亿美元，Frax为19亿美元，LiquityUSD为8.33亿美元，FeiUSD为7.62亿美元。在Apollo，我们继续看涨稳定币。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测5：</strong>Cardano将跌出Coingecko上十大加密货币资产的行列。尽管Cardano远胜于许多其他资产，但这所谓的前十排行榜依然不成熟，并将随着时间的推移而发生巨大变化。至于Layer 1智能合约平台，其竞争正变得愈加激烈。若Cardano仍能保持当前的排名，我会感到很惊讶。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>Cardano并未跌出前十名，目前排名第七。根据DeFiLlama Cardano的数据，在所有区块链中，Cardano拥有最高的市值/TVL 比例。但我认为，其市值下跌的速度会比获取TVL的速度更快。</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Crypto-Powered Future is Already Here</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing is essentially an attempt to predict the future by allocating capital to the most promising companies, technologies, or economic models, adjusted for risk tolerance. In December 2003, William Gibson, one of the most influential Cyberpunk authors, wrote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;The future is already here – it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that some people are already doing and experiencing the futuristic things that the larger population will see as commonplace in the near future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crypto-powered, decentralized, and blockchain-enabled future world is already here; it just hasn’t reached everyone yet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Crypto is eating the world, and it’s happening faster than you think</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years ago in August 2011, Internet pioneer and visionary venture capitalist, Marc Andreesen, published a blog in the Wall Street Journal called, </span><a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Software Is Eating the World</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In it, he described how Software and Web companies were disrupting and supplanting many real-world industries and legacy business models, and at the same time dispelled arguments that this was a dangerous bubble similar to the Dot Com era of the late 1990’s. He should know. Marc was a founder of Netscape, which developed the world’s first user-friendly Web browser, and whose IPO in 1995 sparked that boom and launched the beginning of the Internet Age. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eventual ubiquity and inevitably of Software and the Web looks blindingly obvious with the benefit of hindsight, but it was not well understood nor distributed at the time. The same arguments are now being made against Crypto; that it’s an unsustainable and speculative bubble, a niche technology used by a minority of people, and a fad that will be regulated out of existence if it becomes too successful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto combines software with cryptography and decentralized blockchain technology, and is powered by network effects, viral propagation, consensus governance mechanisms, and transparent financial and behavioral incentives. Many industry participants including Alex Mashinsky and Raoul Paul have already observed that ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now eating the world’, disrupting traditional financial markets and even some of the same software business models that Marc wrote about. Unsurprisingly, Andreesen Horowitz was an early </span><a href="https://a16z.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters-nyt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocate of Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2014, and recently raised a second $2.2 billion venture capital fund to invest in this emerging asset class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Apollo Capital, it is our belief that we have already entered a new era (perhaps ‘the Crypto Age’) where large parts of our daily lives – work, social networks, financial capital, human interaction, entertainment, gaming, music, and artistic creativity – will be digitized and increasingly tokenized to be stored and exchanged on a blockchain. These will be overlapping and interacting networks of value that will benefit from Metcalfe’s Law of exponential growth. Few understand that we are in the midst of a revolution in money, finance, and culture that is in the early days of adoption and price discovery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Traditional Finance is the Main Course</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto has found a major product-market fit in the area of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). DeFi is an emerging ecosystem of financial applications and interoperable protocols built on blockchain technology that has begun eating away at the multi-hundred trillion dollar capital markets including borrowing and lending, market-making, store of value, fixed income, derivatives, foreign exchange, payments, remittances, mortgages, asset management, and interest rate swaps, among others – all without a real world financial intermediary. Instead, ‘smart contracts’, written in software code, control the execution of every transaction, removing counterparty risk and the need for a centralized authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a Cambrian explosion of new DeFi projects, and enormous amounts of capital are already flowing into DeFi as the Total Value Locked (TVL) has reached $195 billion, an 830% increase so far this year. Much of the activity is taking place on the Ethereum network, which settles $500 billion of transactions each month and is on pace to settle $8 trillion in 2021, the most in Crypto. ETH, the native token of Ethereum, which generates more than $20 million in daily fees for network miners, is predicted to become a deflationary asset (the total supply decreases over time) starting in 2022 with its migration to a ‘proof of stake’ consensus model. ETH is being described as ‘ultra-sound money’; a potentially superior store of value and a medium of exchange for a wide range of Internet transactions. Compared to Bitcoin’s singular value proposition of an immutable digital store of value, Ethereum, as the original smart contract platform, has many more use cases in DeFi. The Lightning Network is a “Layer 2” scaling protocol that has been in development for years and will enable faster transactions and payments on the Bitcoin network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The innovative economic structures of the future will not be traditional corporations, but rather </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/2021/07/the-era-of-the-dao/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DAOs), operated by volunteer communities of software and capital contributors with democratic and transparent governance policies enacted by proposal voting according to the ownership of protocol tokens. For Crypto projects, DAOs will replace highly regulated legal and hierarchical structures that are controlled by Board of Directors, full-time management teams, and equity shareholders. Driven by open source software, Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), rather than centralized Stock Exchanges, facilitate roughly $60 billion per month of permissionless peer-to-peer trading, creating high liquidity for the vast majority of tokens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another relatively recent innovation, US-dollar pegged stablecoins, have a current market value of $130 billion and enable near instant transfer of value anywhere in the world. Anyone who has tried to wire money overseas (even to an account they own) knows the pain, delay, and limitations of the byzantine and antiquated banking system. In free markets, improved user experience and reduced cost will always prevail over incumbent solutions. The commercialization of the Web has proven this beyond any doubt. Traditional Banks will either soon experience NGMI (“Not Gonna Make It”), or if they want to retain customer deposits, plug directly into DeFi platforms to offer innovative payment and yield products. The leading centralized Crypto exchange, Coinbase, has announced it will allow customers to deposit paychecks directly to their accounts. Shots fired!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>The Web, Culture, and Gaming will be Dessert</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto will infiltrate and permeate just about everything that’s accessible online, and onboard a large new audience to the Crypto asset ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook, with 2.9 billion global users, recently announced it is betting the company’s future on transitioning into a Metaverse company, and is pursuing plans to launch a Crypto stablecoin called Diem. PayPal has integrated Crypto into its global person-to-person and e-commerce payment network. Visa, Mastercard, and Verifone are doing likewise. Reddit, the Web’s largest discussion board platform, launched an Ethereum-based rewards program for community members. Amazon has been rumored to be researching a token strategy. Companies like Microsoft, KFC, The Dallas Mavericks, Norwegian Air, and countless online stores already accept payment in Crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the first Non-Fungible Token was minted on a blockchain in 2014, NFTs (often priced in ETH) really hit the popular zeitgeist in late 2020 with major drops by artists like Beeple and Trevor Jones setting sales records that rivaled the Masters of the traditional fine art world. EtherRocks, Bored Apes, and Crypto Punks are the new ultimate status symbol assets (or “flex”) with collectors now using these unique digital NFTs as online identity avatars. Twitter will soon allow its 350 million users to authenticate their ownership of NFTs on the platform. Jack Dorsey has integrated Bitcoin into both Square, for investment and trading, and Twitter, for tipping and payments. Multi-chain wallets for storing and transacting in Crypto are already integrated into Web browsers and likely soon into Apple Wallet and Google Pay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online gaming is adopting in-game NFTs and has created a ‘Play-To-Earn’ (P2E) business model where players receive tokens and unique items as rewards, based on their skill and achievements. The leading P2E game, Axie Infinity, is on track to generate $1.4 billion in 2021 revenue and has 350,000 daily players, mostly in the Philippines, who are often earning enough to make a living and support their families. Axie’s $35 billion market cap places it in the top five most valuable gaming companies in the world. Using NFTs, cross-game marketplaces, and the blockchain to verify and transport their avatars and items, Crypto game players will interact in an interoperable virtual universe (aka “The Metaverse”). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fashion and music industries will also incorporate NFTs. Dolce &amp; Gabbana recently sold their first NFT collection for $5.65 million. Songs will soon be tokenized so that fans can participate in their ownership and earn royalties from their favorite artists, establishing music as a new form of investment. NFTs will exist at the intersection of culture and finance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking this trend to its logical and fullest expression, we expect the major Social Networks, gaming companies, music streamers, and Web services will integrate Crypto and decentralize their platforms to some degree. The massive global outage of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp is a glaring example of why a decentralized Web is the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Dinero Mágico de Internet</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very few people (other than Jack Mallers from Strike) expected a country to adopt Crypto in 2021, and yet El Salvador, which translates to “The Savior”, made Bitcoin legal tender alongside the almighty US dollar in June. According to President Nayib Bukele</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 million people or nearly half of the 6.4 million Salvadorans are already actively using the state-backed Chivo Bitcoin wallet. That is more accounts than any single bank in the country and likely on track to exceed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banks in the country. Talk about banking the unbanked!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its historical volatility, Bitcoin is the best performing asset of any kind over the last 10 years. Much concern has been expressed over Bitcoin’s power usage and carbon footprint, and perhaps this is warranted, but Bitcoin will have positive benefits as it monetizes the stranded power from legacy utilities and remote renewable sources. Electric utilities in the US are turning to Bitcoin mining to capture off-peak power and for load balancing. Ukraine has formally legalized Crypto and is exploring Bitcoin mining using nuclear power. Laos and Paraguay are legalizing Bitcoin trading and have announced plans to utilize excess hydro-generated power for mining. El Salvador’s state-owned power company will provide mining facilities with cheap, clean geothermal energy, harnessed from the country&#8217;s volcanoes. Understandably, very few people want to live anywhere near a volcano and the lack of a robust electricity grid can make transmitting power to urban centers uneconomical. Bitcoin fixes this. The limitless geothermal energy can be transformed into digital value and transmitted cheaply. Think of this as a store of abundant energy in a digital battery, or even digital gold that can be dug up and transmitted at the speed of light. In doing so, Bitcoin may ultimately hasten the adoption of renewable energy worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare this forward thinking to the United States where the SEC is still dragging its heels on approving any of the 18 Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications on file. It’s only a matter of time, though, and this will be a major step forward to widespread adoption of Crypto, triggering a huge inflow of new capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong><i>Software Disruption Meets the Velocity of Capital</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Crypto, the disruptive forces of software (digital distribution, iterative improvements, and decentralized contribution) combine with the velocity of capital (highly fluid liquidity that seeks yield, removes inefficiencies and intermediaries) to create a powerful, global, and permissionless 24/7 digital free market whose goal is adoption, efficiency, and exchange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are two relentless and insatiable forces that will drive widespread adoption and propagate Crypto through their inherent positive feedback loops across concentric networks of value. Money is becoming programmable, and the definition of and types of money will evolve and their uses will mushroom. Crypto is truly “the future of finance”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto has the incredible advantage of leveraging decades of global Internet and mobile infrastructure investment and adoption that will facilitate its exponential growth. Roughly 48% of the world&#8217;s population, or 3.8 billion people, own a smartphone and can access decentralized browser-based Crypto and DeFi platforms, democratizing financial inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin, and the entire Crypto movement, was born out of the Global Financial Crisis in 2009, and the ongoing debasement of Fiat currencies, negative real yields, and the growing distrust of government and financial institutions have proven powerful accelerants. The “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/O1hCLBTD5RM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money Printer go Brrr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” meme has done more to explain the current Central Bank monetary policy than any Economics textbook. Innovative companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Galaxy Digital have adopted Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset to help solve the ‘</span><a href="https://youtu.be/WrR95PFYDFQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">melting ice cube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ problem of Fiat currency, as Michael Saylor calls it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With BTC at $47,000 and ETH at $3,300, the entire Crypto market is valued at roughly $2.1 trillion, which would rank it between the market caps of Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft. For reference, the global stock markets are valued at $95 trillion, gold at $11 trillion, the broad M2 money supply is another $100 trillion, and outstanding bonds are valued at $130 trillion. With the current trajectory and inertia, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine Crypto’s market cap increasing 3-10x over the next decade. Bullish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>The Final Boss</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the major risks to Crypto&#8217;s success – technology, value proposition, economic model, product-market fit, and consumer and institutional adoption – are well on the way to being solved. What’s left to overcome? Nation State attacks and unreasonable financial regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve already seen a concerted, multi-year attack by China with its “banning of Crypto” (annually since 2013!) and it’s recent total ban on Bitcoin mining, which caused a mass exodus of miners, a broad market panic sell-off, and a significant impact to the network hash rate (a measure of the processing power that secures the Bitcoin network). Impressively, this forced a dramatic decentralization of the network, which is now reassembling itself in more favorable jurisdictions like the US, Canada, Russia, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and Kazakhstan with the </span><a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hash rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already back to mid-May 2021 levels. This is a long-term positive, removes a key vulnerability, and has proven the Bitcoin network’s resilience and antifragility. Is the Law of Unintended Consequences a thing in China?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems the Final Boss for Crypto to defeat is the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission and what form the now certain regulation will take. Our expectation is that regulation will be a long-term positive as the framework will provide legal, tax, and regulatory certainty, and more formally integrate Crypto into the global economy, allowing broad participation from investment funds, retirement accounts, corporate treasuries, and sovereign wealth funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Apollo Capital, we expect significant ongoing market volatility in the short-term, but we are exceptionally confident in the long-term fundamental thesis that Crypto will power the new decentralized financial infrastructure of Web 3.0. The profound and disruptive innovation will continue despite token price fluctuations, and provide an asymmetric return opportunity for investors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Number Go Up</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To adapt a phrase about Software disruption from Marc Andreesen in 2011, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next 10 years, the battles between incumbents and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-powered insurgents will be epic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. However, Crypto will be different; globally inclusive, open source, censorship resistant, spearheaded by decentralized volunteer communities applying their own capital and ingenuity, fueled by memes and a desire to effect real change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward ten years from now, Crypto’s rise will look obvious and inevitable&#8230; just as the dominance of Software and the Web do today.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enormous credit and gratitude to Marc Andreesen, Mike Novogratz, Jack Mallers, Jack Dorsey, Michael Saylor, Elon Musk, President Nayib Bukele, Satoshi Nakamoto, and Vitalik Buterin for their leadership and inspiration. </span></em></p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Forks</strong></p>
<p class="">Similarly to most successful software products, crypto assets require iterations to the code to:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Fix issues and bugs in code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Add new functionality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Increase performance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="">In software, we see this done via downloadable software updates. In the open-source world of crypto, this is done via a process called &#8216;Forking&#8217;. As ‘Layer One’ crypto assets are primarily decentralised, they require all the active participants in the network that can be referred to as &#8220;nodes&#8221; (miners &amp; validators) to follow the same specific set of rules to function. These sets of regulations combine to be known as the network&#8217;s &#8220;Protocol&#8221;. A Protocol will typically define the following constraints for the blockchain:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Block-size (MBs) on the blockchain that is for mined/validated in the mem pool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The size of the miners’ reward and how it is distributed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The hardware required for running nodes or mining rigs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The mechanism for how consensus in the network is reached (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/">PoW</a>, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">PoS</a>, <a href="http://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/a-brief-introduction-to-hybrid-powpos-consensus-mechanism">Hybrid</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Entitlements for native token holders/participants</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Soft Fork vs Hard Fork</strong></p>
<p class="">As mentioned above, &#8216;Forking&#8217; is a mechanism for updating a &#8216;Layer One&#8217; crypto-asset protocol. It occurs by creating a new chain that is &#8216;branched&#8217; from the original. The branched blockchain is termed the &#8216;Fork&#8217;, and a new protocol will then govern this blockchain. There are two distinct methods. A ‘Layer One’ asset can be forked, either by a &#8220;Hard Fork&#8221; or a &#8220;Soft Fork&#8221;. Details of both are listed below:</p>
<p class="">A &#8216;Soft Fork&#8217; is a change to the network that is &#8216;backwards compatible&#8217;, meaning old nodes that were running before the change will still be able to participate (update to) the new change, as long as they abide by the new subset of rules. If the non-upgraded nodes produce blocks that do not abide by the new set of rules they will not be recognised.</p>

<p class="">A &#8216;Hard Fork&#8217; changes the network so that it is non-compatible with its original network protocol. All un-updated node transactions will not be valid on the new chain rendering it in-computable on the new forked chain until configured properly. A necessary consequence of a hard fork is the duplication of all previous transactions and balances carried onto the new chain. &#8216;Hard Forks&#8217; can be controversial or non-contentious.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Controversial Forks</strong></p>
<p class="">Suppose the &#8216;Hard Fork&#8217; is controversial, meaning the fork results from opposing ideals from developers. In that case, the newly created fork will duplicate all the previous transactions and wallet balances from the original chain. The first block after the fork will now record a brand new version of the crypto asset native to the forked chain. Any developer can fork an open-source blockchain; however, the strength of that fork compared to the original networks will depend on participation from new and existing communities. Two examples of controversial hard forks are; the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork and the Ethereum Classic (ETC) to Ethereum (ETH) fork.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Bitcoin Cash Fork </strong></p>
<p class="">The BCH fork occurred in August 2017 and was due to a subset of developers wanting to increase Bitcoin&#8217;s block size. This change was designed to increase Bitcoin&#8217;s efficiency as a peer to peer currency by allowing more transactions per block. Today 1 BCH is worth 1.45% of a Bitcoin, which is a steep drop from its previous all-time high, which saw a ratio of 26.2% in December of 2017. One of the main causes for the substantial decline is illustrated in our previous blog post ‘<a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2018/11/20/how-the-bitcoin-cash-splitnbspunfolded">How the Bitcoin Cash Split Unfolded</a>’. As most of the Bitcoin community favoured keeping block sizes smaller, Bitcoin Cash is now considered a less successful &#8216;Layer One&#8217; crypto asset to Bitcoin. This sentiment expressed by the community is why we now refer to the most significant crypto-asset globally as a store of value asset, with many coining it as &#8216;Digital Gold&#8217;.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Ethereum Fork </strong></p>
<p class="">Ethereum (ETH) was created due to a hard fork. In this instance, Ethereum Classic (ETC) was not the forked chain but the original Ethereum chain. This fork resulted from the core developers&#8217; response to the original Ethereum being hacked in the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists">&#8216;The DAO Attack&#8217;</a>. Instead of allowing the hackers the $60M in Ether of what was currently the mainchain, they forked the chain off and restored the lost funds to the victims of the attack on the forked chain. The portion of the community that retained the original log of transactions and balances from The DAO hack did not upgrade the software and continues on the original network, Ethereum Classic.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Non-Contentious Hard Fork</strong></p>
<p class="">A &#8216;Non-Contentious Hard Fork&#8217; is designed to implement protocol upgrades. These will likely have been stated on a project&#8217;s roadmap since their inception or, in Ethereum&#8217;s case, after switching the consensus method to Proof of Stake (PoS). A planned hard fork looks to upgrade and enhance the blockchain&#8217;s capabilities and features. As a result, the entire community, spearheaded by the core developers, will transition to the upgraded version of the blockchain.</p>
<p class="">An example of a less contentious hard fork (a minority of miners have been opposed to it) is Ethereum&#8217;s &#8216;London&#8217; due on the 4th of August, block 12965000. The &#8216;London&#8217; fork is part of Ethereum&#8217;s multi-phase upgrade plan as the network progresses to 100% Proof of Work and &#8220;Sharding&#8217; as a scalability solution. Ethereum&#8217;s &#8216;London&#8217; fork will introduce the following five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to the protocol:</p>

<p class="">In this article we will explore the up and coming scaling solutions for the Ethereum blockchain and outline how we are positioning the portfolio to take advantage of the opportunities that will arise from these developments.</p>
<p class="">When it comes to tackling the problem of scaling, there have been various ideas tested and researched over the years and we believe that these solutions are on the brink of ushering in a new age for the Ethereum blockchain. Beyond these scaling solutions, we will explore other key developments that are contributing to ETH’s price strength.</p>
<p class="">For the purposes of this article we will not explore the scaling solutions known as ‘Plasma’ and ‘State Channels’. This is because these solutions lack the ability for users to perform complex transactions and will not result in DeFi scaling.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Rollups vs. Sidechains</strong></p>
<p class="">Sidechains are a leading scaling solution for Ethereum, with chains such as Polygon (MATIC) exploding in value and activity recently due to increased adoption by top DeFi developers and projects. Sidechains are often looked down upon by Ethereum believers as they do not inherit the security of the Ethereum blockchain. Instead, they rely on their own security measures and employ their own consensus mechanisms to process transactions.</p>
<p class="">Many different sidechains like xDAI, Raiden Network and SKALE have been in development for years with many raising significant funding in the 2017 ICO bubble. The adoption of these chains by the Ethereum community has been extremely low due to their lack of security and decentralisation. The only sidechain solution to really take off has been Polygon, this has been driven by NFT projects such as Zed Run and trusted DeFi projects adopting the ‘Ethereum Virtual Machine’ (EVM) compatible chain.</p>
<p class="">‘Roll ups’ differ to side chains as they bring the security of the Ethereum mainchain to layer 2 while making transactions fast and inexpensive. Rollups are solutions that perform transaction execution outside the main Ethereum chain (layer 1), but post transaction data on layer 1. As transaction data is on layer 1, this allows rollups to be secured by layer 1. There are two leading types of Rollups that are aiming to gain the adoption of the Ethereum community, these are ‘Optimistic Rollups’ and ‘ZK-Rollups’ (or Zero Knowledge Roll ups).</p>

<p class=""><strong>ZK- Rollups</strong></p>
<p class="">Zero knowledge rollups use a smart contract to bundle hundreds of transfers off-chain and generate a cryptographic proof, known as a SNARK (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge). This is known as a validity proof and is posted on layer 1.</p>
<p class="">The ZK-rollup smart contract maintains the state of all transfers on layer 2, and this state can only be updated with a validity proof. This means that ZK-rollups only need the validity proof, instead of all transaction data. With a ZK-rollup, validating a block is quicker and cheaper because less data is included.</p>
<p class="">There are already multiple projects using ZK Rollups but the adoption of these projects has been relatively unimpressive. The main decentralised exchanges using ZK Rollups are Loopring &amp; ZKSwap. to analyse the current success of these exchanges we will look at the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the protocol. TVL is an important measure for decentralised exchanges as liquidity is the lifeblood of these projects.</p>
<p class="">Loopring is the oldest DeFi project to use ZK Rollups with their initial release occurring in December 2019. Since then, the protocol has managed to attract only US$213 million in TVL with 11.2% of that TVL being the protocol’s native token, LRC.</p>
<p class="">ZKSwap offers a better user experience and recent liquidity mining efforts has attracted US$385 million in TVL over the past 5 months. Much like Loopring, a reasonable amount of this TVL is the protocol&#8217;s native token, ZKS.</p>
<p class="">When we compare the adoption of Loopring and ZKSwap to the recent uptake in projects built on Polygon (MATIC), we can see that these projects are well on their way to being left behind. For example, after extending their product offering to support Polygon, SushiSwap has managed to acquire US$654 million in TVL in less than 2 weeks after launching mining incentives.</p>
<p class="">We believe that the DeFi adoption of ZK Rollup solutions will continue to be relatively low, especially when Optimistic Rollups are set to be adopted by multiple DeFi ‘Blue Chips’ in the near future. One reason for this is the significant developer work that needs to be done to migrate existing smart contracts to ZK Rollup. However, we do believe that ZK Rollups are better suited for Non Fungible Tokens and we are actively looking for infrastructure opportunities in this space.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Optimistic Rollups</strong></p>
<p class="">Optimistic Rollups are the most exciting scalability solution when it comes to DeFi applications. While Polygon has amassed a reasonable DeFi TVL of US$13.73 billion (according to Defi Llama), we believe that the favoured solution in the long term will be one that inherits the security of layer 1 Ethereum.</p>
<p class="">Optimistic Rollups use a sidechain (Optimism) in order to complete the complex smart contract computation that would usually be completed on layer 1, the result is then sent back to layer 1 and recorded on the blockchain. Since this computation is the most slow and expensive part of a transaction, using Optimism greatly reduces the demand for Ethereum layer 1.</p>
<p class="">Optimistic Rollups are called ‘Optimistic’ because they assume that all transactions are ‘innocent until proven guilty’. Meaning that after a transaction is made there is a time period where fraudulent transactions must be identified by users or bots. If someone notices a fraudulent transaction, the rollup will execute a fraud-proof and run the transaction&#8217;s computation, using the available state data. This means you may have longer wait times for final transaction confirmation than a ZK-rollup, because it could be challenged. This also means that getting your assets off Optimism could take up to a week to allow enough time for the transaction to be challenged. Although this sounds like a major pain point, it is likely that liquidity bridges will form between layer 1 and Optimism.</p>
<p class="">Optimism is set to fully launch in July 2021 with Synthetix being the poster child for the launch and Uniswap following soon after. With these two heavy weights of DeFi, EVM compatibility (making migration for existing protocols easy) and a community looking to break free from high gas fees, we anticipate that Optimism will experience a rush of liquidity and adoption over the second half of 2021. Apollo Capital’s portfolio is extremely well positioned to capture this value with our core positions consisting of many of the Ethereum DeFi ‘Blue Chips’ that are likely to adopt the scaling solution, including Synthetix and Uniswap.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Ethereum 2.0/Sharding</strong></p>
<p class="">While the focus near-term for Ethereum has moved to rollups such as Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups, Ethereum 2.0 includes a scaling solution for the base layer called shard chains.</p>
<p class="">The idea with sharding is to spread the load over 64 new chains. Towards the end of 2021 it is expected that the current chain will merge with the PoS Beacon chain. At that point Ethereum will fully transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). In 2022 we could see the launch of sharding that will bring further scaling to Ethereum. At this point, the details of sharding are still being worked out by Ethereum developers.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Polygon</strong></p>
<p class="">Polygon’s PoS chain has seen a dramatic increase in TVL during 2021. Polygon is sometimes referred to as a pegged chain as it uses Ethereum mainchain for checkpointing.</p>
<p class="">It is likely that trusted Ethereum DeFi projects such as Curve, AAVE, mStable, Sushiswap and 1inch have expanded onto Polygon in response to the rapid rise of the Binance Smart Chain. Since Polygon is EVM compatible it takes relatively little effort for the developers of these projects to launch on Polygon. Polygon’s broader vision is to support a multi-chain Ethereum ecosystem that includes ZK Rollups, Optimistic Rollups together with Polygon’s own PoS chain.</p>
<p class="">We believe that Polygon’s native token, MATIC, will continue to accrue value and the network will continue to gain traction among quality Ethereum developers and projects. We are positioned to capture value in MATIC as well as the ‘Blue Chip’ projects that have adopted the chain.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Other Chains</strong></p>
<p class="">As Ethereum has experienced network congestion and increasing fees, this has led to users adopting other blockchains with much lower fees. Perhaps the best example of this is Binance Smart Chain (BSC) which has seen a surge in usage and TVL during the past 6-9 months. BSC currently has over $41bln in TVL with Uniswap fork PancakeSwap having over half of that at $9.83bn. Other alternative blockchains seeing traction include Solana ($1.36bn TVL), Terra ($3.17bn TVL) and Avalanche ($382M TVL). Polkadot is another chain that we believe will experience traction when it launches with its full capability later in the year.</p>
<p class="">So far the EVM compatibility, meaning developers can easily migrate smart contracts from Ethereum, has been a clear competitive advantage for the likes of BSC and Avalanche. EVM compatibility also makes user acquisition easier as the same infrastructure in terms of key management and wallets can be used.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Other Ethereum Developments &#8211; EIP-1559</strong></p>
<p class="">Ethereum is scheduled to receive a highly anticipated upgrade called “EIP-1559” in July. The successful introduction of this &#8220;Ethereum Improvement Proposal&#8221; will significantly change the network fee mechanism and reduce the amount of new ETH issued in that the base transaction fees will be “burned” rather than added to the circulating supply. Network miners will still be compensated in the form of an inclusion fee (or a “tip”). From an investment perspective, the effect of this upgrade will be to increase the scarcity of ETH and could drive the price higher over time as there will be a stronger bond between the activity on Ethereum and the price of ETH.</p>

<p class="">President Trump recently shared his thoughts on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. We were unsurprised to learn that he is not a crypto enthusiast. The President’s concern that crypto assets are “based on thin air” is not uncommon. Crypto assets are not backed by anything. But the premise that an asset cannot be valuable if it is not backed by something is short-sighted. Gold, fiat currencies and paintings are all valuable assets not backed by anything. The true determinant of whether something is valuable is the tension between supply and demand for that particular asset.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">First, let’s start with valuing assets. How do we value assets? The simple answer to this age old question is the value of anything comes down to what someone is willing to pay for it. The financial services industry has developed models and techniques to determine the value of a variety of assets. While these models might help determine a range of potential values, the inputs to the models inevitably involve a great deal of subjectivity. (Let’s consider the alternative. If the models didn’t involve subjectivity, everyone would use the same inputs, the models would provide the same answers and asset prices wouldn’t fluctuate). Valuation is art as much as it is science and while these models may help, the true value of an asset comes down to what someone is willing to pay for it. Any other definition can only be theoretical.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">How do we work out what someone is willing to pay for an asset? The answer: markets and the forces of supply and demand. Markets exist to facilitate the trade of assets. Less liquid assets are traded infrequently and price discovery is more difficult. Supply and demand are the forces that drive markets. Supply comes from issuing new assets and from sellers of existing assets. Demand comes from buyers looking to purchase at an attractive price. The value of any asset comes from the ever-present tension between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Markets tell us that crypto assets are valuable. Crypto markets are currently worth around USD$250bn. That’s a lot of value based on thin air! As is the case with every other asset class, supply and demand determines the value of crypto assets. Supply comes from new assets, increasing supply of existing assets and sellers. Demand comes from the increasingly large number of people who are realising the value of crypto assets. The question is not “how are crypto assets worth anything if they’re not backed by anything?” Rather, the pertinent question is “what is it about crypto assets that makes them valuable”? The answer: crypto assets have unique characteristics that are unlike anything else known to mankind.</p>
<p class="">Crypto assets often have the following unique characteristics:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Scarcity &#8211; using Bitcoin as an example, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence. If we think of Bitcoin as money, this is ‘hard’ money. Unlike fiat currencies governed by central banks, it is impossible to print more bitcoin, thereby devaluing all the other bitcoin</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Digital &#8211; crypto assets are digital. The concept of assets in the digital ether is often difficult for people to grasp, they cannot touch or feel it and nor do they receive a share certificate. Native digital assets can be traded digitally with less friction than alternatives. As the world becomes more and more digital, digital assets make sense</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Utility &#8211; crypto assets can be used for a variety of purposes, with different assets suited to different means. People can use Bitcoin as a personal, unseizable bank account, and all they need is a smartphone and internet connection. Crypto assets are often programmable, leading to a number of novel use cases, often disrupting and disintermediating incumbents. The unique economic model of crypto assets means they can capture enormous amounts of value in the process.</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">Let’s compare Bitcoin to gold. Why is gold valuable today? The short answer is because of supply and demand. There is demand for gold because it has always been valuable, because thousands of years ago, a group of people decided that gold has a number of unique properties which meant it would function well as a form of money. Gold is somewhat scarce, so it cannot be duplicated and printed (unlike today’s fiat currencies). Gold is durable, so people can store their wealth with some degree of assurance. It is malleable so it can be shaped into functional coins. Gold is fungible, meaning any piece of gold is replaceable with another piece of gold. Gold, particularly when shaped into a coin, is portable, meaning it can be carried around and exchanged with other people to facilitate trade. Gold became valuable because of these properties. The people of the day decided that gold is valuable and should be valued. This cycle developed further and further until gold was recognised as being valuable, by people all over the world.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">It is important to note that this process did not happen overnight. Imagine presenting a group of people a new asset and proclaiming that it should be immediately valuable. It takes a long time for people to realise the value of a new asset class, as they become familiar with the asset and as network effects develop. Just as gold did not become valuable instantly, nor did crypto assets and nor will they realise their full value for some time.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">If we compare Bitcoin to Gold, Bitcoin’s properties are superior. Bitcoin is more scarce than gold, easier to transfer, more divisible, equally fungible and easier and cheaper to store. On top of this, Bitcoin is programmable and is impossible to seize, unlike gold in the United States in the 1930s which was seized by President Roosevelt. The only advantage gold has over Bitcoin is it’s shiny. In time, more and more people will realise Bitcoin’s superiority to gold, demand will increase and the value of Bitcoin will increase. The estimated market capitalisation of gold is between US$8 and US$10 trillion dollars. Given Bitcoin’s current market capitalisation of around US$170bn, we believe there is a strong case that Bitcoin will capture some of the value from the gold market which is around 50 times larger.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Fiat Currency</strong></p>
<p class="">When we talk about crypto assets as currencies, many compare to fiat currencies (US Dollar, Australian Dollar etc) which is “backed by governments.” I often smirk when I hear  people say the US Dollar is backed by the full faith and strength of the US government. The problem with this argument is this ‘backing’ exists until it doesn’t. Fiat currency is valuable, until it’s not. If macroeconomic problems creep in, people start to doubt the value of the currency. Once doubt creeps in, it can be a slippery slope until the currency is worthless.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Sadly, there is no clearer example of this than the current state in Venezuela. Hyperinflation has recently been reported at 10 million percent and the local Bolivar currency is worthless.</p>

<p class="">Let’s consider a painting by Claude Monet. A Monet painting is not backed by anything other than a canvas. The painting has no intrinsic value. Yet, it is undeniable Monet paintings are valuable. Different paintings by Monet will have different value, depending on the particular beauty of those paintings. And of course, paintings by Monet are scarce. Monet died in 1926, so we know that there will never be any more Monet paintings.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">We can draw a comparison to crypto assets. Crypto assets and rare paintings are backed by nothing, they have no intrinsic value. Yet this does not stop them from being valuable. Investors often ask why crypto assets are valuable if we can simply create new crypto assets. We would say the same about paintings. I can paint a picture of some water lilies at my local pond, but this will likely be no more valuable than any crypto asset I produce. The crypto asset that I create needs to have unique characteristics that are deemed valuable by the broader crypto community, just as my painting needs to be deemed valuable by the art community.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">&#8212;</p>
<p class="">The advantage that gold, fiat currencies and paintings have over crypto assets is they have been recognised as valuable for centuries, even thousands of years. Crypto assets are ten years old. It is highly unlikely that the value in the US Dollar will evaporate over a short period of time. While we think it is also unlikely this will happen in crypto assets, any unravelling of value in crypto assets is more likely than the same for assets which have long been recognised as valuable. In this regard, crypto assets are riskier than the traditional assets discussed, and this is well known and understood.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Crypto assets have unique properties that make them valuable. They are not backed by anything, they might be based on ‘thin air’, but this does not mean they are not valuable.</p>
