<p class="">In <em>The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography, </em>Simon Singh takes the reader on a journey through the history of encryption. He traces the evolution of cryptography and details its dramatic effects on wars, nations and individual lives. In reading <em>The Code Book</em>, it becomes clear that throughout history, there has been a constant tension between codemakers and codebreakers. At times, the codebreakers have had the upper hand. Other times it has been the codemakers.</p>
<p class="">The codemakers are currently winning the battle. Current encryption methods appear impregnable, successfully securing our online transactions, data and messages. Popular messaging services like WhatsApp offer “end-to-end encryption”, meaning messages can only be seen by the sender and receiver. If a message were to be intercepted, it is nearly impossible to decrypt. While words like “cryptography” and “encryption” often attract sinister connotations, they are used more widely and more positively than people might think.</p>
<p class="">Crypto assets are governed and protected by cryptography. Indeed, “crypto assets” are so-called as they are based on cryptography. Crypto assets combine knowledge of several academic fields including mathematics, computer science, finance and cryptography.</p>
<p class="">Cryptography is fundamental to the security and operation of crypto assets. And that cryptography is very strong. We like this infographic which shows the likelihood of cracking a Bitcoin private key.</p>

<p class="">While modern day codemakers have the upper hand on codebreakers, what are the threats to this position? Will quantum computing be the secret weapon of the codebreakers? Could this affect the security of crypto assets?</p>
<p class="">
<strong>Quantum Computing</strong></p>
<p class="">Quantum computers are powerful machines that are an order of magnitude more powerful than today’s most advanced computers. Without delving into the detail, quantum computing allows computers to work through problems by performing calculations in parallel, rather than sequentially.</p>
<p class="">Google has claimed “quantum supremacy” over the most powerful supercomputers in the world, by solving a problem considered virtually unsolvable for modern day computers. It’s quantum computer, called Sycamore, has claimed to have completed a complex calculation in 200 seconds. The same calculation would take the world’s most powerful supercomputers 10,000 years.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Threats to Crypto Assets</strong></p>
<p class="">It is impossible to predict how technology will evolve. It is tempting and attention grabbing to make wild predictions, but we will focus on what we know.</p>
<p class="">Blockchain networks appear safe. Blockchain ledgers are distributed to thousands of participants. It is impossible to simultaneously alter everyone’s copy of the record.  No data block can be removed or modified without affecting all other blocks, requiring consensus.</p>
<p class="">Quantum computing might pose as a threat to public key cryptography, the backbone of blockchain security. Put simply, incredibly powerful quantum computers might change the equations in the image above.</p>
<p class="">Many experts believe the threat of quantum computing will arise in the next ten to 15 years. The preceding paragraph applies assuming quantum computing advances, but cryptography stands still. Today’s quantum computers exist only in the lab. Accordingly, the codemakers are adapting with proposed countermeasures in the form of quantum-proof cryptography. By the time quantum computers are available to the wider public, it is reasonable to expect that most cryptocurrencies will have already made the leap into a quantum-resistance movement.</p>
<p class="">
<strong>—</strong></p>
<p class=""><em>The Code Book</em> by Simon Singh has at least one clear lesson: encryption methods are safe, until they are not. Codemakers have throughout history developed impregnable encryption methods, to realise that they are in fact breakable. Leading cryptographers and crypto asset projects will need to stay on top of these developments. However, perhaps unlike previous users of cryptography throughout history, with a market value of a quarter of a trillion dollars, the bounty on the security of crypto assets, and the value that needs to be protected, might be historically unprecedented.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">Ownership of crypto assets is about control. ‘Owning’ a crypto asset allows the holder of the private keys to control future transactions of those crypto assets. Ownership of crypto assets doesn’t feel the same as ownership of other assets, which usually comes with physical possession and/or legal rights.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Let’s look at an Ethereum transaction. I provide Bob my Ethereum public address and he sends me 5 ether. My public address can only be controlled by the corresponding private keys, which I store securely. A helpful way to think about public addresses and private keys is like email. Anyone can send to my email address (public address), but only I can send from my email address with my password (private keys).</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">I now ‘own’ 5 ether and this ‘ownership’ affords me the right to control those 5 ether. They have been assigned to whoever has the corresponding private keys, which in this case is me. The 5 ether will always reside on the Ethereum blockchain. I cannot take my 5 ether off the Ethereum blockchain, store them on my hard drive and at a later date bring them back onto the Ethereum blockchain to sell or transfer them. They are digital assets that live on the Ethereum blockchain. The 5 ether I own are assigned to me, or transferred to me, such that I now have control of 5 ether that I did not have before. I, and only I, have the ability to control these 5 ether through my private keys.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Ownership of crypto assets doesn’t feel like ownership in the same sense that I own a house or I own a gold bar. Ownership of other assets comes with more than just control, usually physical possession and/or legal protection.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Let’s consider other assets:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Gold &#8211; owning a gold bar likely means I have physical possession of that gold bar, which I can store in a vault or bury in my backyard. I continue to own the gold bar until I sell it or forget where I buried it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Property &#8211; owning land gives me control of the land, physical possession and legal rights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Shares &#8211; after buying shares in a company, my name goes on the company’s register. Nowadays, this is largely a digital experience. I have control of these shares until I sell them, usually on an exchange. Sometimes I do not have control of these shares, where for instance I am a minority shareholder and a critical mass of shareholders decide to sell all the shares in a company to an acquirer, in which case I am also forced to sell my shares</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Cash (paper money) &#8211; I control and have physical possession of the $20 note in my wallet, but ownership of cash in circulation resides with governments and central banks. I control the cash until I exchange it for goods or services</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Ownership of crypto assets is limited to control. There is no physical possession or legal protection. This might feel like a weaker form of ownership, but it is arguably the strongest form of ownership. Crypto assets are the only assets in human history which are unseizable. Cash, gold, shares and property can all be seized by the centralised actors behind these assets. Unfortunately, this is not an uncommon experience where governments cannot always be trusted to act in the best interests of their citizens.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Crypto assets are digital assets that reside on a digital ledger where ownership is the assigned right to control future entries on that ledger. If I buy or receive more crypto assets, I have the ability to control more future entries on that ledger in the future. This may seem incredibly simple but it is, in fact, incredibly powerful.</p>

<p class=""><em>This article was inspired by </em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/blockchain-bandit-ethereum-weak-private-keys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>an article in Wired</em></a><em> titled “A ‘Blockchain Bandit’ is Guessing Private Keys and Scoring Millions”. It’s a fascinating story of how a security consultant uncovered how millions of ether has been transferred out of Ethereum wallets over the years.</em></p>
<p class="">An Ethereum private key is a random 78-digit string. That’s an impossibly large number to guess. My favourite analogy relates to the number of grains of sand on earth. Now imagine each grain is another earth with as many grains as ours. That’s on the order of magnitude the number of different combinations that’s possible in the public key cryptography that is used by cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p class="">A weak key could be generated if there is a fault in the random number generation algorithm and since computers are deterministic, random number generation is a really hard (and interesting!) problem. Another way to generate a weak private key is to use a so called brain wallet. Let me explain, brain wallets are based on a user defined passphrase. The idea here is that with a passphrase that you can remember, you will always have access to your crypto. The passphrase generates the private key in a deterministic way, so instead of the 78 digit randomness, the private key possible combination space has now collapsed down to the length of your passphrase. Humans are not very good at picking a strong passphrase, and if you need to remember the passphrase, which is point with a brain wallet — it gets so much harder to choose a strong passphrase.</p>
<p>In the early days of crypto, <a href="http://bitaddress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitaddress.org </a>was a popular web site to generate your private keys, your paper wallets and it also provided an easy way to generate a brain wallet. The site is still up and running today:</p>

<p class="">It currently contains no bitcoin — no treasure for us to claim!</p>
<p class="">The scenario here is that someone has created a very weak, guessable private key (‘satoshinakamoto’), to store bitcoin. A vigilant person or programmed bot has detected the incoming transaction, easily worked out the private key and then sent the bitcoin to their wallet. All this is easily programmed to happen automatically.</p>
<p class="">This shows the importance of protecting your private keys and generate them in a secure way. There is an army of people and bots out there that will jump at the chance of redeeming your private key, a point the Wired article drives home.</p>
<p class="">But I think there is broader lesson and understanding here — and that’s what I call the <strong>Unwritten Rule of Crypto</strong>.</p>
<p class="">The unwritten rule of crypto is that if you have the private key, you’re the owner. Another popular way to put it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">Not your keys, not your crypto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">The key in crypto gives the holder the right to change the ledger — that’s the software enforced rule of blockchains.</p>
<p class="">There is a clear analogy to the DAO hack. The DAO was a very popular decentralised application on Ethereum during its early days. The smart contract code of the DAO contained a vulnerability which meant that funds from the DAO could be moved out.</p>
<p class="">The software code (or rule) of the DAO said those funds could be moved. Just like having access to a private key gives you the right to update the ledger, the DAO ‘hacker’ had the right to move those funds.</p>
<p class="">This led the Ethereum community to roll back transactions like they never took place. That decision created a fork of Ethereum and we now have the original blockchain without the rollback, Ethereum Classic and the forked chain, where the ‘bail out’ took place, Ethereum.</p>
<p class="">Just like transactions are immutable, are exploits in smart contracts fair game? Supporters of Ethereum Classic would say ‘yes it is’ while some elements of the Ethereum community would disagree.</p>
<p class="">For many of us, <strong>‘code is law’ </strong>is our motto. With the help of crypto we can create something that is as trustless as possible. We ask ourselves what’s the point of blockchain if not for being trustless. We are building a new future based on code. That code is the law of the blockchain.</p>

<p>As I write this blog post, the Australian government has just enacted a decryption bill that<a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/govts-decryption-bill-can-only-lead-to-systemic-weaknesses-512390" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> according to experts can only lead to systemic weaknesses</a> that will put us all at risk.</p>
<p>Apple is protesting this bill in a letter saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Encryption is simply math. Any process that weakens the mathematical models that protect user data for anyone will by extension weaken the protections for everyone.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple and others are arguing that it is precisely because of the threats from criminals and terrorists that we need strong encryption.</p>
<p>Indeed it was likely software from an Israeli firm sold to governments and used by <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/02/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-whatsapp-messages-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saudi Arabia to spy on Jamal Khashoggi’s WhatsApp messages</a> that later lead to his brutal murder.</p>

<p>Privacy has always been front of mind for the cypherpunks in the digital cash and cryptocurrency community. For many of these people privacy is a basic human right.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin, money for the first time became indistinguishable from speech. This was predicted by cypherpunks decades ago. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_May" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timothy C. May</a>, a founding member of the cypherpunk movement, <a href="http://osaka.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/articles/tcmay.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in ’97</a> that ‘Digital Cash = Speech’. As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are open source software (arguably a form of speech), lines of code are now money.</p>

<p>Cypherpunks understood that if you like to support (including financially support) the opposition in say Saudi Arabia or Russia — a private means of communication might mean the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous, other cryptocurrencies offer in-built privacy. Dash was an early fork of Bitcoin offering a mixing technology for private transactions. Monero is a well known privacy focused coin using ring signatures which combines signatures to obfuscate the inputs to a transaction.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko_Wilcox-O%27Hearn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zooko Wilcox</a>, a cypherpunk who worked for David Chaum at DigiCash founded Zcash, it marked a new area in private cryptocurrencies. Zcash uses zero-knowledge proofs to provide absolute privacy. We can think of zero-knowledge proof as a way to proof something without revealing our secret. As an example, when I log-in to password manager Lastpass, that service has stored a hash of my password. Since a hash function as one-way function, it is enough to transmit the hash of the password to Lastpass, not the actual password — in other words, I don’t have to reveal my secret.</p>

<p>We are now close to the launch of a new technology which combines privacy with scalability. This technology is called MimbleWimble and one implementation of this, Grin, is set to launch next month. A <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/grins-michael-cordner-aka-yeastplume-on-implementing-mimblewimble" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent episode of the ‘What Bitcoin Did’</a> podcast gives a good overview of MimbleWimble and Grin. MimbleWimble transactions are based on proofs that input minus outputs are zero, thus very little data needs to be revealed and the blockchain will stay very small.</p>

<p>We are actively investing in some of the technologies helping to bring financial freedom to everyone in the world. Apollo Capital holds Bitcoin, Zcash, we invested in <a href="https://www.orchid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orchid</a> protocol which is building a more secure Internet and we look forward to the launch of Grin. For Bitcoin, the Lightning Network being built on top of Bitcoin could potentially provide more privacy there too.</p>
<p>The good news here is that cryptography is a rare technology where it is much easier (and not just a little bit easier) to defend yourself than to attack — due to a fundamental asymmetry behind public-key cryptography.</p>
<p>Open source + cryptography can and will continue to protect speech — both in the form of conversations and digital money. With the advent of encryption laws like we are seeing in Australia — open source software becomes a critical infrastructure for communication and free speech. With cryptocurrencies cypherpunks are extending the roam of free speech to digital money — a development very much still ongoing.</p>
