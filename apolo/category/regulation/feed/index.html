										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">Australia is yet to regulate digital currencies other than for money laundering and counter-terrorism purposes. Other than operating digital currency exchanges, Australia does not have specific laws or a specific framework that regulates crypto assets. Australia is relying on applying old laws to fit around crypto assets, rather than developing new laws specifically tailored to this new technology.</p>
<p class="">A decision in March this year, <a href="https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/5e70069ce4b096e236c2170a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Bigatton [2020] NSWSC 245</a>, considered the legal status of Bitcoin and crypto assets in Australia.</p>
<p class="">The case considered the question of whether the defendant’s dealings with the proceeds of the BitConnect Lending Program amounted to dealing in the proceeds of crime.</p>
<p class="">The BitConnect Lending Program was an investment vehicle that allowed investors to profit from a BitConnect trading bot and volatility software. According to Wikipedia, BitConnect was a ponzi scheme that promised 1% daily compounded interest. The BitConnect Lending Program was closed down in January 2018 and investors incurred substantial losses. The Bigatton case noted some of the investors lost in excess of $10,000.</p>
<p class="">It was alleged that the defendant, Mr Bigatton, was the Australian National Promoter of BitConnect, a virtual currency or cryptocurrency business. It was alleged that the defendant converted amounts he received from his role as National Promoter of the BitConnect Lending Program to make mortgage payments of over $576,000 and purchase a motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="">The defendant denied being the Promoter of the BitConnect Lending Program. The defendant also alleged the bitcoin or any cryptocurrency is not money.</p>
<p class="">The <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=28075563-060b-46c8-9a98-35e76a18d378&amp;utm_source=Lexology+Daily+Newsfeed&amp;utm_medium=HTML+email+-+Body+-+General+section&amp;utm_campaign=Lexology+subscriber+daily+feed&amp;utm_content=Lexology+Daily+Newsfeed+2020-08-20&amp;utm_term=">summary of the Bigatton</a> case examined the question of what is Bitcoin?</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">On generally accepted principles of what is money, we could conclude that a digital currency is money.  It is a medium of exchange and can be used as a method of payment.  However, section <strong>8(1) of the (Cth) Currency Act 1965 (Currency Act) states that the monetary unit, or unit of currency, of Australia is the dollar</strong>. Section 9(1), so far as it is relevant, requires every transaction, dealing, matter or thing relating to money or involving the payment of, or a liability to pay, money to be made, executed, entered into or done according to the currency of Australia, unless the currency of some other country is used. Section 11(1) requires that every payment, unless made according to the currency of some other country (of which Bitcoin is not), be made according to the currency of Australia.”</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Digital currencies such as bitcoin on the other hand are generally treated as property </strong>and not currency. This is spelt out in more detail in the Guidance Note from the Australian Taxation Office ‘Tax treatment of crypto-currencies in Australia – specifically bitcoin.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<h2>The Australian Tax Office</h2>
<p class="">The Australian Tax Office considered the status of bitcoin and crypto assets in a <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?src=hs&amp;pit=99991231235958&amp;arc=false&amp;start=1&amp;pageSize=10&amp;total=7&amp;num=3&amp;docid=TXD%2FTD201425%2FNAT%2FATO%2F00001&amp;dc=false&amp;tm=and-basic-TD%202014%2F25">2014 Tax Determination. </a></p>
<p class="">The Commission for Taxation noted the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">It has been argued that bitcoin satisfies the ordinary meaning of money because on a functional approach it satisfies three essential elements for money because it serves as (1) a medium of exchange, (2) a unit of account, and (3) a store of value. In addition, it is argued that there is widespread usage and acceptance of bitcoin in the community as a means of discharging debts and making other payments, and accordingly bitcoin&#8217;s increasing acceptance has now reached the point that it qualifies as &#8216;money&#8217;. This later point is very much a question of fact and degree. The evidence available to the Commissioner informs the view that the current levels of use and acceptance of bitcoin within the community is far short of what may be regarded as sufficient or necessary to satisfy the test in Moss, nor is it a generally accepted medium of exchange as per Travelex. Accordingly, <strong>bitcoin does not satisfy the ordinary meaning of money.</strong></p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">The meaning of &#8216;the currency of Australia&#8217; (or &#8216;Australian currency&#8217;) under the Currency Act is the monetary unit established by that Act as the requisite unit of account, and means of discharging monetary obligations, for all transactions and payments that are not made according to the currency of another country. Conversely, &#8216;the currency of some country other than Australia&#8217; &#8211; the only other species of &#8216;currency&#8217; according to which transactions and payments can proceed under the Currency Act &#8211; must be any monetary unit recognised by another country&#8217;s laws for the same purposes. Therefore, <strong>the critical character of the Currency Act&#8217;s concept of &#8216;currency&#8217; is State recognition and adoption of a monetary unit under law</strong>. This approach under the Currency Act reflects the position taken in Mann on the Legal Aspects of Money, namely that money &#8216;must exist within some form of legal framework, because it reflects an exercise of sovereignty by the State in question&#8217;.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">The Commissioner considers that when defining &#8216;foreign currency&#8217; as &#8216;a currency other than Australian currency&#8217; in section 995-1, Parliament intended to use the term &#8216;currency&#8217; in the same sense that &#8216;currency&#8217; is used in the Currency Act &#8211; namely, a currency legally recognised and adopted under the laws of a country as the monetary unit and means of discharging monetary obligations for all transactions and payments in that country. Consistent with the Currency Act, this concept of currency is in turn divided into two types for the purposes of the ITAA 1997:</p>
<p class="">1. Australian currency, and</p>
<p class="">2. Every currency that is recognised and adopted by the laws of any other sovereign State as the monetary unit and means of discharging monetary obligations for all transactions and payments in the respective sovereign state (that is, foreign currency).</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>As bitcoin is not a monetary unit recognised and adopted by the laws of any other sovereign State as the means for discharging monetary obligations for all transactions and payments in a sovereign State, it is not &#8216;foreign currency&#8217;</strong> for the purposes of Division 775 of the ITAA 1997.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">A taxpayer that receives bitcoin as payment for goods or services they provide as part of their business, or uses bitcoin to make purchases for their business, is required to include the arm&#8217;s length Australian dollar value of their bitcoin transactions in calculating their assessable income</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">We note that there is evidence that some of these comments are outdated. While admittedly on a small scale, one example is <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/swiss-canton-takes-taxes-in-bitcoin-as-crypto-goes-mainstream">Switzerland’s tech friendly hub Zug</a>, home to hedge funds, crypto firms and commodity traders, which will start allowing citizens to pay taxes in Bitcoin and Ether. Perhaps this, and other developments, will help Bitcoin’s recognition as a means to discharge monetary obligations.</p>
<h2>
Anti-Money Laundering</h2>
<p class="">One area where the law is clear in Australia is the operation of digital currency exchanges.</p>
<p class="">Under the AML/CTF Act, digital currencies involve the converting of Australian or foreign currency in Australia to a digital currency or a digital currency into Australian dollars or a foreign currency in Australia. Section 5 specifically defines a digital currency to mean “(a) a digital representation of value that:</p>
<ol data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">functions as a medium of exchange, a store of economic value, or a unit of account; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">is not issued by or under the authority of a government body; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">is interchangeable with money (including through the crediting of an account) and may be used as consideration for the supply of goods or services; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">is generally available to members of the public without any restriction on use as consideration……”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="">In short, if a person operates a digital currency exchange, they must enrol with Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC).</p>
<p class="">A number of Australian exchanges have recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/australian-exchanges-delist-privacy-coins-amid-chainalysis-integration">delisted privacy coins due</a> to “pressure from external forces.” We believe it is not unreasonable to believe these external forces are due to the AML/CTF issues associated with privacy coins.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<h2>Our View at Apollo</h2>
<p class="">At Apollo, we believe the current legal situation is adequate, but in time, crypto assets will require their own defined regulation. In our opinion the current legal situation in Australia is working relatively well. Most cases involving crypto assets are covered. One cannot unlawfully sell financial products disguised as crypto assets. One cannot operate a digital currency exchange without registering with AUSTRAC. One cannot raise money for an ICO or crypto project without adhering to the laws relevant to raising capital. The tax situation is clear &#8211; every instance of trading crypto assets is a taxable event, much like trading multiple foreign currencies.</p>
<p class="">However, we think that crypto assets will inevitably require clear and dedicated regulation. A legal sandbox might be a smart way for regulators and market participants to experiment and determine the best way to regulate crypto assets. We don’t suggest this needs to happen immediately. Indeed it may be wise to wait until the use and design of crypto assets evolves and matures. The crypto asset space is evolving so quickly it would be difficult to introduce regulation now and continuously update it. Perhaps it makes more sense to wait until the pace of technological advancements has slowed.</p>

<p class="">In Computer Science a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protocol</a> is a specification of the rules of a communication system — it’s a foundational standard that we can lean on and build more complex applications on top of.</p>
<p class="">In Western democracies, the fundamental rights, or put another way, the protocol of a society is enshrined in its constitution. The United States is well known to have strong protections for press freedom and free speech in its Bill of Rights. Likewise, many other democracies such as Britain and Sweden have strong protections for free speech. Australia is the Western democracy standing out in this regards, and not for a good reason. Australia is without strong press freedom or free speech protected by its constitution. In fact, recent years have seen a deterioration in that regard. We have recently seen a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/04/federal-police-raid-home-of-news-corp-journalist-annika-smethurst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journalist</a> and a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-15/abc-raids-australian-federal-police-press-freedom/11309810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news agency</a> being raided by the federal police, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-03/ato-whistleblower-facing-prison-says-he-almost-died-from-stress/11167954" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ATO whistleblower is facing jail time</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/a-top-cardinals-sex-abuse-conviction-is-huge-news-in-australia-but-the-media-cant-report-it-there/2018/12/12/49c0eb68-fe27-11e8-83c0-b06139e540e5_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a gag order put on media in relation to the Catholic cardinal sexual abuse case</a>, and perhaps the most systematic dangerous of them all, <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/dangerous-overreach-on-encryption-leaves-backdoor-open-for-criminals-20181214-p50mak.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an encryption bill</a> weakening our communications. This is what the press is protesting about in Australia by for one day censoring their first page.</p>
<p class="">Protocols are really hard to change — they’re in fact designed that way for a good reason, and sadly we don’t see strong protections coming to Australia anytime soon.</p>

<p class="">However technology can perhaps provide some remedy. Below are some example of where cryptography is able to provide civil liberties independent of where in the world you happen to live.</p>
<p class=""><strong>1. Secure Communication</strong></p>
<p class="">The cypherpunks, a movement started in the late 1980s., aimed to achieve privacy and security through proactive use of cryptography. Their <a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manifesto</a> reads: “Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. … We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy … We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. … Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and … we’re going to write it.”</p>
<p class="">They realised early on that technology can create a place of freedom, some new ground that others can’t infringe on.</p>
<p class="">With the help of cryptography such as end-to-end encryption we can communicate freely and no one can eaves drop or censor that communication. Cryptography is a unique technology in that it is many orders of magnitude easier to protect encrypted messages than to attack the same. This asymmetry is also what crypto assets depend on.</p>
<p class="">Out of this movement we got things like encrypted email. Cypherpunk and cryptographer Phil Zimmerman created a new protocol for secure email communication called PGP.</p>
<p class=""><strong>2. Secure Assets</strong></p>
<p class="">For assets, crypto offers an alternative to today’s dependency on centralised institutions. These are opt-in immutable networks with strong protections against censorship.</p>
<p class="">Nick Szabo, leading crypto though leader and polymath, recently introduced the concept of deep safety to assets:</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">We can think of today’s assets in three layers:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class=""><strong>Digital centralised — these have poor deep safety.</strong> Examples would be money in your bank account, shares held by your broker, or a Gold ETF. Digital centralised assets are totally dependent on the goodwill of centralised organisations or companies. That trust has been abused throughout history in many places of the world. Countries with strong protections on the protocol level such as the US have been successful in fulfilling this trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""><strong>Physical assets — better deep safety. </strong>Examples Szabo provides above include Real Estate and Gold. Physical assets have been the best protection throughout history because they were the best alternative. However they have the <a href="https://twitter.com/nickszabo4/status/992056245707128836?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severe flaw</a> being dependent on un-secure physical locality and local transactions. It is fundamentally hard to protect something physical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""><strong>Trust-minimised crypto networks — unprecedented deep safety</strong>. Examples include crypto assets such as Bitcoin. Cryptography gives us unprecedented security, once we encrypt something and we do it properly, in a probabilistic sense it is game-over for the attacker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class=""><strong>3. Secure Contracts</strong></p>
<p class="">With the rise of smart contract platforms like Ethereum, agreements can be made purely based on computer code.</p>
<p class="">Lending platform Compound currently has $153M of capital earning interest across 7 markets. Implemented correctly, the lenders on these markets are not dependent on the solvency of a single financial institution — instead security is coded in algorithms. It is trust-minimised in the sense that access and security is not in the hands of humans.</p>
<p class="">Decentralised exchanges use smart contracts to remove the third-party risk in trading. Depositing assets on a centralised exchange exposes you to counter-party risk as you give up direct ownership of those assets. With smart contracts we can trade in a trust-minimised way with minimal third party risk. This brings unparalleled security to trading.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p class="">The trust-minimisation of crypto networks means we can place less trust in organisations and fallible humans and instead use software to create digital bearer instruments, transfer value peer-to-peer and create other, more complicated contracts running purely on unstoppable software. This increases social scalability as we can trade and make agreements with anyone in the world without having to trust a third party. This is what we call the Trust Revolution:</p>

<p class="">While we don’t have much hope of a top-down movement rewriting the protocol of the society, by reducing the amount of trust we have to place in our current institutions in the first place, their importance is likely to decrease over time. Crypto brings us a glimpse of hope as more and more people are opting in to this new way of transacting offering permissionless financial freedom to everyone in the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week the Apollo Capital team dialled into a webinar focused on crypto regulation. The webinar was jointly held by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/">CoinDesk</a> and DLA Piper. A panel of experts reported on the recent gathering of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) on crypto regulation. The session was one of the most comprehensive meetings of senior regulators, bringing together central bankers, the Financial Conduct Authority (UK), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the Financial Stability Board.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of key points from the webinar:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are two broad competing tensions facing regulators: promoting growth while protecting consumers. On one hand, crypto is viewed as a huge opportunity to drive forward growth on a global scale. On the other hand, regulators are wary of protecting consumers and investors from unscrupulous operators, ICOs trying to circumvent existing regulation, and ensuring financial stability.</li>
<li>Regulators are taking different approaches. China has banned ICOs, India has expressed concerns. Gibraltar and Switzerland have proactively encouraged development of token products. Approaches differ despite the umbrella regulator for the regulators, the International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO), issuing principles and guidance. Christine Lagarde, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), recently <a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2018/04/16/an-even-handed-approach-to-crypto-assets/">stated</a> that “because crypto-assets know no boundaries, international cooperation will be essential.” It’s heartening to see global regulators promoting intergovernmental cooperation. Apollo Capital supports this but is also aware of the difficulties in establishing regulatory frameworks at a global level.</li>
<li>Forum shopping is a concern. Regulators are concerned about ICO issuers ‘shopping around’ for the most favourable jurisdictions. In an increasingly globalised society, jurisdiction shopping is becoming prevalent. Countries that take an anti-crypto stance risk losing innovative projects to more friendly jurisdictions.</li>
<li>This is a different type of technology may not fit the paradigm that applied when laws were set out in 1930s and 1940s.</li>
<li>In the US, Federal laws are the biggest obstacles pushing ICO issuers outside of the US. Despite progress from States like Wyoming, Federal securities laws trump State laws. While State laws have frequently been test grounds for new Federal regulations, the US risks losing the battle of crypto innovation. In terms of enforcement, the SEC hasn’t yet reprimanded anything that hasn’t been outright fraud. For example, the SEC highlighted the DAO as a security that contravened securities laws. However, the SEC hasn’t taken any enforcement action.</li>
<li>We are seeing signs of progress. Earlier this year in February, the US State of Wyoming unanimously passed two pro-crypto Bills. HB 70 defines utility tokens as neither traditional money nor securities. HB 19 exempts cryptocurrency from money transmission laws. Combined, the bills recognise utility tokens under law as a new class of property.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From an investor’s perspective, Apollo Capital’s approach to regulation is clear &#8211; buyer beware. As managers of an actively traded portfolio, we remain careful not to invest in crypto assets that likely contravenine current securities legislation. It’s not worth the risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apollo Capital will continue to watch the global regulatory framework evolve. We look forward to keeping you updated.</p>
