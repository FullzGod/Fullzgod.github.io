<p class="">This article is co-authored by Tim Johnston, Managing Director of Apollo Capital and Michael Armitage, Principal of Fundlab</p>
<p class="">Markets are fascinating. The current macroeconomic backdrop is especially interesting. Not only are we in the middle of a decades-long global money printing experiment, we are in the middle of a severe global pandemic that threatens the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Many global economies are in recessions. And yet as investors, we continually ask ourselves, where to from here?</p>
<p class="">At Apollo Capital we have the privilege of speaking to a wide variety of investors, from high net worth individuals, to family offices and small institutional investors. At times it appears no one is bullish on any asset class. Below, we consider the outlook for the traditional asset classes: equities, bonds and real estate. Australian investors will need to work harder and smarter than they have previously. The time for simply being levered long real estate and long equities has passed.</p>
<p class=""><em>Please note, the below is not investment advice. The consideration of these asset classes is simply a high level description of how we view the current state of traditional assets. Please do your own research, form your own conclusions and by all means, let us know if your view differs.</em></p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Equities</strong></p>
<p class="">We believe an outlook on equities involves reconciling two competing forces: valuations and global money printing.</p>
<p class="">First, valuations. From the investors we speak to, it is hard to come to any conclusion other than valuations of equity markets are stretched. That’s putting it diplomatically. Some valuations are ludicrous. The chart below is the historical Price Earnings (PE) Ratio for the Australian All Ords Index. We can see that the market’s PE ratio did not even revert to its long term average when markets were first impacted by Covid-19 in March. As markets have recovered, so has the average PE ratio, trending back to elevated levels.</p>

<p class="">The current PE Ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is around 28 and is significantly higher than average. The valuations of many tech stocks are astronomical.</p>
<p class="">Shopify is one example of the extreme valuations placed on leading technology companies. Shopify recently announced second quarter financial performance. Total revenue for the second quarter was $714.3m, GMV was $30.1 billion and operating income was $300,000. Annualised, those numbers are revenue $2.8bn, GMV around $120bn and operating income $1.2m. Shopify as a whole is valued at around $116bn, meaning Price to GMV is around 1, Price to Revenue is around 41 and the Price to Earnings is around 1,160. These are incredible numbers! Investors are clearly pricing in a huge amount of growth.</p>
<p class="">While it may not be fair to analyse one stock in isolation, tech stocks are increasingly leading global equity markets. Perhaps this time is different &#8211; valuations of companies, especially technology companies have been high for a long time, and investors have generated strong returns investing into already expensive technology stocks. Then again, if you’ve <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/This-Time-Different-Centuries-Financial/dp/0691152640">read the book</a>, this time is never different.</p>
<p class="">An investor would be brave to bet against equities, both global and domestic. We believe equities are largely being propped up by the flood of liquidity from global central banks. This new paradigm has been the case for a number of years, equities have been expensive for a long time now, yet they have continued to become more expensive, culminating in one of the longest bull markets in history.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Bonds</strong></p>
<p class="">We believe the outlook for bonds and fixed interest is negative. Bonds appreciate in periods of falling interest rates. Interest rates have been falling for a very long time and are arguably at ground zero. Some longer dated government bonds are trading at negative rates, meaning investors are not receiving any interest. Rather, they are paying to receive the notional amount in the future. These investors are of the view that rates will decrease further into negative territory.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Real Estate</strong></p>
<p class="">We are bearish on commercial real estate and neutral on residential real estate. We predict commercial property will suffer from a decades-long shift from centralised working in CBDs to flexible remote working conditions. We were already seeing the start of this trend which has been dramatically accelerated as Covid-19 has impacted our lives. The surveys are clear &#8211; workers prefer to work from home. Assuming your average worker would prefer to work from home 2 to 3 days a week, we question whether that will lead to a 40-60% reduction in demand for commercial real estate. It might not be that simple, a worker might still need a space, even if they are not using it, but we believe the writing is on the wall for commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="">Australian investors have amassed vast amounts of wealth from being levered long residential real estate over the past 30 years. Australian investors love property, but we think the love story is coming to an end due to the bottoming out of interest rates. Australian property investors have benefitted from falling interest rates for nearly 30 years. While property has seemed expensive for a very long time, the ability to service mortgage repayments has eased dramatically. While it can be difficult to buy into the market, once investors have bought in, interest rates have fallen, investors find it easier to pay off their mortgage, their house inevitably appreciates, they believe property is a high return, low risk investment and they rinse and repeat. This cannot go on forever. Australian property may benefit as mortgage interest rates decline to reach the same levels as our global mortgage rates (around 1-2%). However, residential real estate investors would be brave to expect the same returns over the next 30 years as we have seen over the previous 30 years.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Opportunity Cost</strong></p>
<p class="">With a bleak outlook for traditional asset classes, investors must consider where to from here? Some will increase their allocations to defensive assets like cash and government bonds. Many have and will increase demand for alternative assets like gold and crypto assets. We ask investors &#8211; what is the opportunity cost of allocating to crypto assets? What are investors foregoing by shaving one or two points from traditional assets in favour of crypto assets? We believe the opportunity cost is low. In return, investors gain exposure to an area showing promising growth that is uncorrelated to traditional assets.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">&#8212;</p>
<p class="">The main reason investors would shun crypto assets is risk. Crypto assets are volatile, the technology is young and there is a not insignificant risk of permanent loss of capital. Let’s flip the question around &#8211; what are the risks in traditional assets? With stretched valuations in equity markets, a bleak macroeconomic outlook and global interest rates at ground zero, perhaps investors are underestimating the risks in equities, bonds and real estate. When analysing the risk of traditional assets, the low opportunity cost of investing in crypto assets, their uncorrelated nature and enormous growth potential, the prospects of crypto assets looks increasingly favourable. The question then becomes which investors are prepared to work harder, do the research and take on the reputation and professional risk associated with suggesting such an allocation.</p>

<p class="">Convexity is an interesting concept that explains why investors should pay attention to crypto as an asset class.</p>
<p class="">I believe there are actually two ways that crypto has convexity. The first one is more technical and the second one more broadly related to individual crypto assets and portfolio allocation:</p>
<ol data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class=""><strong>Crypto has deeply rooted technical convexity </strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="">As a former options trader, I learned that convexity is the concept of positive gamma. Gamma is the rate of change of the price sensitivity to the underlying price. If you’re ‘long gamma’ you will become more sensitive to price changes as the price goes up. Long gamma is a nice situation to be in, as the price goes up you will make more and more money (Short gamma on the other hand should be avoided like the plague.)</p>

<p class="">Why is crypto be ‘long gamma’? On a high level, base layer protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum are creating an immutable ledger where value and contracts can be exchanged between any two parties. That network only has value if the security is strong enough, i.e. the network is only trustless if we don’t have to worry about a rollback of previous transactions.</p>
<p class="">Since Bitcoin and Ethereum’s miners are paid in bitcoin and ether, the trustlessness of these crypto networks is a direct function of the price of those assets. Put another way, the value of the network as a secure ledger goes up as the price increases. This reflexivity means that 1. the network effect in crypto networks is strong 2. the immutability and thus the value proposition of the network increases with price — this self reinforcing effect is a form of positive gamma!</p>
<p class=""><strong>2. Crypto has convexity both in the micro and macro</strong></p>
<p class="">On the micro scale, there is a lot of experimentation and competition going on in crypto markets. If you have exposure to a diversified portfolio of crypto assets you are more likely to capture the returns from breakout crypto assets. This is the reason why we are building a portfolio aligned to our investment thesis that is diversified between different verticals and technologies . In option parlance we’re said to be ‘long volatility’. We can view the portfolio as a collection of call options.</p>
<p class="">Here it makes sense to mention another Greek letter, namely Theta. A call option has a negative theta, meaning that as time passes the value of the call option will decline as optionality decreases. If crypto assets are call options, I’d argue that the theta of a crypto asset is positive. This is due to the Lindy effect, which says the future life expectancy of a non-perishable thing like technology increases with time. Unlike call options that expire at a given time, crypto assets don’t expire. Instead, they prove themselves over time and become more trustworthy as time passes. If Lindy is valid for crypto assets, then they just have to survive to be successful — that’s a convex bet in time.</p>
<p class="">Secondly, on the macro side of things. By having 5% of crypto assets in your portfolio you are exposed to an asset class with limited downside (all of crypto is only US$150bn, a fraction of one company like Facebook) and with limitless upside. This has the added advantage that you can take much less risk with the rest of the portfolio. Instead of cultivating a portfolio of securities with average risk and average return expectations you can instead construct a portfolio where 90 or 95% of the portfolio has very little risk, maybe just enough to cover inflation while the rest of the portfolio has unlimited upside. Prof. in risk and philosopher Nassim N. Taleb describes this Barbell Strategy this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">“If you know that you are vulnerable to prediction errors, and accept that most risk measures are flawed, then your strategy is to be as hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive as you can be, instead of being mildly aggressive or conservative.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">We believe this very asymmetric return profile coupled with the uncorrelated nature of crypto assets makes this a very unusual and attractive asset class. On the contrary if you’re short, you have limited upside (100%) and unlimited downside.</p>
<p class="">The above reasons summarise why I like to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""><strong>‘Crypto is Convexity for your Portfolio’.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There two big, emerging areas of value creation in the crypto space. These are centred around what we call <strong>‘Money-ness’</strong>and <strong>‘Governance’</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Money-ness</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>We added the suffix ‘- ness’ after money to emphasise the breadth of this category. Money-ness encompass everything from a global store of value to a currency specific to a crypto-economy or use-case.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The categorisation of crypto assets is oftentimes not clearcut (actually, almost never clearcut!). Take Bitcoin as an example. It’s deflationary and limited in supply, global, and not issued by a central authority. These qualities make it look very similar to gold. On the other hand, however, bitcoin derives value from being used as a currency to pay for goods and services. This is because it is easy and cheap to transfer globally and highly divisible. Settlement in Bitcoin has occurred globally on average every 10 minutes for almost a decade; Bitcoin’s smallest unit, a Satoshi, is one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin or 0.00000001 BTC. In this sense, it acts as <strong>both </strong>a digital gold equivalent and as an M1 (or cash) equivalent. With the introduction of the Lightening Network, the dual-character of bitcoin becomes even more pronounced.</p>
<p>On the other end of the money-ness spectrum you have pure utility tokens. Utility tokens are used to pay for a good or service in a particular crypto-economy, much like a laundry token is used in the physical world.</p>
<p>The category of money-ness is thus very broad but the defining question should always be<em><strong> </strong>&#8220;can this token act like money?&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Not all tokens in this the money-ness category are created equally for value accrual purposes. <strong>In our opinion, </strong><strong>in the long run store of value forms of money-ness will </strong><strong>accrue value while utility tokens won&#8217;t. </strong>This is because of the relative velocity, or turn over, of these forms of money-ness.</p>
<p>An example of a utility token is Binance Coin (BNB). BNB is used to pay transaction fees on the Binance crypto exchange. The major issue with the explosion of utility tokens is that if every good or service had its own token, we would all be driven mad trying to keep up with such a variety of currencies. No one would want to hold onto hundreds of utility coins that pay for hundreds of separate goods or services. The implication from all this is that the velocity for many if these coins is likely to be very high, and therefore the value of utility tokens will be low.</p>
<p>Why? Because rather than holding 100s of currencies, <strong>we are much more likely to hold just </strong><strong>one store of value</strong><strong>, then seamlessly swap in and out of utility tokens as we need them. </strong>Most people will not even realise that they are using distinct utility tokens as this process will be automated. In this version of the future, the velocity of utility tokens would be very high as people are not incentivised to hold the tokens for any length of time. Currently people are holding onto utility tokens for speculative reasons, but that incentive will recede when tokens begin to be used for their stated purpose. People won&#8217;t need to hold onto (or &#8216;HODL&#8217; in crypto-speak) utility tokens but will instead buy and sell them on-demand. This increases in the velocity of the token, and according to the <strong>value exchange equation, </strong>the network value <strong>tends towards zero </strong>with increased velocity:</p>
<p><strong>MV=PQ</strong></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<blockquote><p>M = Money Supply</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>V = Velocity of Money Supply (i.e. the amount of times the money supplies turns over)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>P = Price Level</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Q = Index of new real expenditures</p></blockquote>
<p>Because of this velocity problem, teams behind ICOs, developers and investors have attempted to artificially lower velocity as they all have an interest in increased network value over time. This have lead to discussions over clever ways to create ‘velocity sinks’ in order to increase the token value. However, we perceive this as not a viable way to create value.</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p>A common example of where a utility token may be needed is for a decentralised markets in the sharing economy. Mike Novogratz, founder of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital Management, likes to highlight the example of a decentralised model for ride-sharing. It&#8217;s also a good example of why utility tokens won&#8217;t accrue value.</p>
<p>Uber is the highest valued private tech company in the world with a market capitalisation of $69.9bn. In a Decentralised-Uber (dUber) equivalent little value would likely accrue in the dUber token itself. We can think of that difference in value between Uber and dUber being mainly due to the radical reduction in the 25%+ cut that Uber captures in fees. This fee would by definition be almost eliminated in a dUber world. As a user, the application layer would automatically trade bitcoin, for example, into dUber tokens in real time so the user never actually holds onto it for a substantial period. You may not even realise there was a token in the middle, and potentially only see you BTC balance change following the ride.</p>
<p>Lastly, utility tokens may not accrue value due a lack of network effects because of, funnily enough, utility. Existent crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum can often be used in place of a utility token like the Binance Coin. A concerning number of the projects that come across our desk at Apollo Capital do not need their own native token, and simply staple one of for fundraising purposes.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure utility tokens might not capture much value at all, because the velocity will likely be high.</li>
<li>Many projects might not need their own token. The value of an artificial token used for fundraising is <strong>highly</strong> questionable.</li>
<li>On the investment side, we see value accruing in the store of value that incentivise HODLing, rather than in utility tokens that incentivise high velocity trading.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, many tokens are not pure cut, and crypto-assets used to fuel smart contract platforms like Ethereum’s ETH can be in part store of value, in part currency, and in part utility for paying gas on the Ethereum platform. There are clearly different degrees of ‘Money-ness’, but these principles should help in deciphering which token will likely have long term value, and which will not.</p>

<p>The other big value creator in crypto is governance. We’re in a phase where projects experiment with how governance is distributed and architectured within crypto networks.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s governance is distributed between different stakeholders like miners, developers, users, wallets, and exchanges. In Decred, the coin holders have a much larger say in how the network is developed through their hybrid proof-of work/stake system. Other systems like Tezos are inventing new forms of on-chain governance. The 0x project was thought of as a utility token, but is turning into more of a pure governance token. The relayers in the 0x eco-system do not actually need to use the 0x token for payments, and are using it rather to vote on governance. The team behind 0x realises that as velocity goes to infinity, the payment aspect of 0x is not actually where the value lies.</p>
<p><strong>Governance in itself is valuable. </strong>If you want to control the future of the protocol you’re investing in or building an app on top of, the governance is very valuable. Do you think Apple considers it&#8217;s ability to determine what apps can and cannot go on their App Store as valuable? Of course they do. And the app developers would also find it valuable if there was a way for them to contribute to the App Stores governance. At the moment, app developers on iOS have no say on the governance of the Apple app store. <strong>Open crypto networks enable community-led governance, or, in classic crypto jargon, <em>decentralised governance. </em> </strong></p>
<p>Crypto assets represent new methods to organise society based on merit and free markets. Governance is a critical factor in these networks. <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/crypto-commons-da602fb98138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This</a> is an excellent article about network governance by Mike Maple, Jr.</p>
<p>How these values are captured are critical issues to think about for developers as well as for investors in this space.</p>
<p>In our emerging decentralised world of crypto assets, Money-ness and Governance are two of the leading value creators. This is where Apollo focuses investment.</p>
