										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto asset market is experiencing the most turbulent times in the market’s history. Various large centralised institutions are becoming insolvent, with each week passing more news comes to light of trouble market players. In this article, we will outline how these centralised entities have harmed the market through excessive risk-taking behaviour performed in a non-transparent fashion. We will then look at how transparent DeFi protocols have performed throughout these volatile times providing examples with crypto assets held by Apollo Capital, showcasing their consistent market demand through generating consistent cash flows for liquidity providers and token holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Centralised Finance (CeFi) Troubles</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celsius is a CeFi platform that offered investors lucrative interest rates on their crypto assets held on the platform. The business was founded in 2017 and enjoyed explosive growth in the years that followed due to their widespread marketing and general ease of use for retail investors.</span><a href="https://celsius.network/about-us"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">According to their website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Celsius was managing US$11.82 billion in assets (17 May 2022) and had processed US$8.2 billion in loans, making them an important crypto market participant for many years.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1512 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--1024x753.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="552" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--1024x753.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--300x221.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--768x565.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius-.jpg 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Celsius&#8217;s Announcement to their Users on the 12th of June 2022</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On 12 June 2022, Celsius announced that it was suspending “all withdrawals, swaps and transfers between accounts”. The freezing of customers&#8217; assets caught many users off guard, as they viewed Celsius as a reliable and safe way to store their crypto assets as advertised on their social media, website and via referral partners. Also portrayed in their messaging were their safe and reliable yield generating practices which lead users to believed Celsius generated the yield for their customers through direct crypto lending and conservative DeFi practices. In reality, they were undertaking riskier business practices to earn this yield, with no transparency on their procedures and strategies. Some mainstream media outlets have previously labelled Celsius as a DeFi platform along with the various referral partners on social media. However, this was simply not the case &#8211; as DeFi protocols provide complete transparency and on-chain verification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Celsius platform, user deposits are treated as a liability on the balance sheet, similar to a bank. The platform’s underlying profitability depends on its ability to take these deposits and earn a higher yield than they are required to pay depositors. With insufficient demand from the market for direct crypto loans, CeFi platforms allocate their assets into DeFi protocols and staking to meet their yield targets. The key events that led to the insolvency of Celsius included losing 38,000 ETH to the platform ‘Stakehound’, losing US$54 million in the Badger DAO hack, general liquidity requirements mismanagement and large user withdrawals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the full extent of the Celsius collapse is yet to be realised, it is the everyday user who suffers due to the risk-taking behaviour of a centralised entity. While hacks in DeFi can also be devastating for retail users, CeFi platforms have long engaged in marketing tactics that entice less sophisticated investors to utilise their products and carry the risk. </span></p>
<p><b>Risky Lending Practices &#8211; Three Arrows Capital (3AC)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before its insolvency, Three Arrows Capital was a proprietary trading firm that earned a considerable reputation in the crypto market by making concentrated bets and securing enormous profits. They were highly sought after VC style investors in the primary markets and amassed US$10-15 billion in assets throughout the bull market. Their downfall was catalysed by enormous losses from the collapse of LUNA and the following broader market sell off. It is rumoured that 3AC’s debt could amount to around US$1 billion, with the flow on effects likely to have a lasting impact on both retail and institutional investors alike.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder of Three Arrows Capital, Zhu Su broke his Twitter silence with this tweet on the 15th of June.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1521 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--1024x516.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="378" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--1024x516.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--300x151.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--768x387.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su-.jpg 1166w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3AC used their reputation to gain under-collateralised credit lines from risk seeking centralised lenders who were fiercely competing with each other, leading to irresponsible lending practices. It is reasonable to assume that many of these lenders would not have had a clear view into the balance sheet of 3AC. Whether that was through ignorance, fraud or a mixture of both, is up for speculation. The transparency offered by decentralised finance poses a stark contrast to these centralised entities. Smart contract enabled financial applications do not distinguish between users’ reputations,  they are transparent pieces of code that simply keep functioning, day after day. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MakerDAO &amp; DAI</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MakerDAO is a great example of stability in the DeFi ecosystem despite the current market conditions and volatility caused by centralised entities and poorly designed crypto assets. After the Luna / UST collapse, one of our analysts spoke of the importance of MakerDAO and its over collateralised stablecoin DAI in an</span><a href="https://stockhead.com.au/cryptocurrency/apollos-moonshots-strength-in-maker-convex-opportunity-and-luna-crash-silver-linings/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">interview with Stockhead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. MakerDAO has demonstrated the importance of decentralisation and thoughtful design in peer-to-peer networks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can ‘mint’ DAI against the crypto asset collateral they choose to deposit into the protocol’s smart contracts. The amount of DAI minted by the user becomes a debt, repaying this debt by ‘burning’ the minted DAI plus interest unlocks this deposited collateral. DAI is pegged to the US dollar and is considered to be the most decentralised over-collateralised stablecoin. The decentralised aspect of DAI is an important reason that MakerDAO has been able to survive these market conditions and continues to flourish. The main reason for DAI’s decentralisation is because the collateral used to mint DAI are primarily the most decentralised crypto assets like ETH and BTC with the only requirement for a user to mint DAI being a crypto wallet, with no KYC needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minimum collateral ratio that users are able to borrow for certain asset types is 130%, meaning if the user wanted to borrow 10,000 DAI, they must collateralise their position with at least $13,000 worth of ETH. Also known as the liquidation ratio, if the collateralised value drops below this number, the borrower will be subject to partial liquidation to cover outstanding debt, this comes with a liquidation fee of 13%. Due to MakerDAO&#8217;s transparency and being able to view all data on the blockchain, investors do not have to worry about misleading and unethical behaviour that stems from centralised entities who have hidden information from users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Stability, Total Value Locked, Revenue, On-Chain Statistics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the recent turmoil and volatility in the crypto markets, the DAI token has proven itself as a truly stable and trustworthy stablecoin. DAI uses what is known as a Peg-Stability Module (PSM) to ensure it has a 1:1 valuation with the US Dollar. The Peg Stability Module allows users to swap a given collateral type directly for DAI at a fixed rate, rather than borrowing DAI. The PSM contract allows users to swap other stablecoins such as USDC for DAI, making DAI’s peg very stable as any variation in the price can be arbitraged. The transparency and stability achieved through the implementation and reiteration of the protocol’s design over several years is a testament to the ultimate goal of Decentralised Finance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are able to look at other stablecoins such as UST and USDT when comparing the stability of DAI’s peg. However, DAI is the only decentralised stablecoin backed by on-chain crypto, which strengthens the support of its peg. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MakerDAO is currently trading at $1020 with a market cap of $1 billion and total value locked (TVL) of approximately $7.9 billion, which accounts for over 10% of the TVL in the entire DeFi space. The amount of BTC locked in the protocol is at an all time high with approximately 68,000 BTC locked (wrapped BTC on the Ethereum blockchain). With market conditions forcing some centralised companies into insolvency, MakerDAO has generated an annual total revenue of $34.9 million, and is one of the highest grossing DeFi protocols.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Aave</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aave is a highly renowned DeFi money market where users can supply and borrow crypto assets at an interest rate determined by the supply and demand of funds in the protocol. Aave is another major DeFi protocol that has survived the test of time while centralised lenders have caused disruption and uncertainty in the market. Aave is available across many layer one ecosystems such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Artbitrum, Harmony and layer twos such as Arbitrum and Optimism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the over-collateralisation mechanics of the Aave lending market as well as the community’s careful approach to only enabling highly decentralised and ‘safe’ crypto assets, there has never been a default case or ‘bad debt’ on the platform. The trust and stability of Aave are evident through its growth in user volume to $9.74 billion of liquidity locked across 7 networks and over 13 markets. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1522 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--1024x558.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="409" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--1024x558.jpeg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--300x163.jpeg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--768x418.jpeg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms-.jpeg 1484w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Aave &#8211; TVL, Revenue, On-Chain statistics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aave has implemented many risk parameters to ensure the stability of the protocol. When market conditions change, risks change. Specific parameters include the loan to value and liquidation thresholds related to the risk of each of the assets available in the Aave protocol. A liquidation in Aave occurs when a borrower&#8217;s collateral value is not properly covering their loan/debt value, thus the user&#8217;s health factor falls below 1. To prevent these types of liquidations, Aave users are able to over-collateralise so that they can cover their debt and reduce the risk of their assets falling below their liquidation level. This has limited the number of liquidations that have occurred on the protocol and has encouraged more users to safely borrow on the protocol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the number of liquidations that have occurred on Aave’s protocol has totalled $24.2m. This number is very small compared to the total liquidation value this year of over $2 billion. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lending Market Liquidations</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1524" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="774" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI.jpg 1290w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1290px) 100vw, 1290px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAVE is currently trading at $66.30 and has a market cap of around $920m with a Total Value Locked of approximately $6.75 billion, the second highest TVL out of any protocol in the DeFi sector. The lending protocol also has an annualised total revenue of $68.6m, which the majority is distributed to the lenders on the protocol who earn interest on the capital they lend. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Uniswap</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap is the leading decentralised exchange (DEX) in DeFi. Unlike centralised exchanges and entities, Uniswaps transactions are all stored in the blockchain and are available for everyone to see &#8211; displaying their transparency and trust with its community. Using smart contract interactions, the protocol facilitates automated transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol supports thousands of digital assets and stable coins across the Ethereum ecosystem and is crucial for the stability of the DeFi sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap recently surpassed $1 trillion in lifetime transaction volume, more than any other decentralised exchange. Uniswap liquidity providers earn a percentage of the transaction fees which incentivises them to provide liquidity &#8211; which is an example of the community engagement that is supported by decentralised entities. Despite the recent downdraws in the global markets, the transaction volume on Uniswap continues to rise and many new users are interacting with the protocol. </span></p>
<p><b>Uniswap &#8211; TVL, Revenue, On-Chains statistics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap reached an all time high valuation of $45 in May of 2021. It is currently trading at $5.68 and has a fully diluted market cap of around $5.14 billion. The TVL in Uniswap is approximately $5 billion , making it the 4th largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL. Uniswaps exchange has generated an annualised total revenue of $750 million, making it the highest grossing DeFi protocol, with most of the revenue distributed to liquidity providers. The total revenue generated by the exchange is up 65.3% for the year, which illustrates the protocol&#8217;s stability and importance compared to many other centralised exchanges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Monthly DeFi revenue</b></p>
<p><b> </b><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1523 size-full" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1.jpg" alt="" width="2401" height="1260" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1.jpg 2401w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-1536x806.jpg 1536w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-2048x1075.jpg 2048w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-1568x823.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2401px) 100vw, 2401px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global financial markets continue to shake the digital asset class and challenge the stability of the decentralised financial sector. However top protocols such as MakerDao, AAVE and Uniswap have proven that they can be successful and perform well despite the turmoil caused and exhibited by centralised entities. These are just a few of the top decentralised applications that continue to generate positive cash flows in a transparent manner for token holders and users. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What struck me when watching the first game of the first round of the AFL season a few weeks back, which incidentally was the 2021 Grand Final rematch between the Western Bulldogs and the Melbourne Demons, was the overt ‘crypto’ presence that was on my TV screen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watching that Grand Final rematch rarely was there a moment during the telecast that crypto didn’t have a visual presence. The jumper sponsor for the Western Bulldogs, CoinSpot – an Australian based Cryptocurrency exchange, was prominent. Crypto.com, a major sponsor of the AFL, could be seen via fence advertising around the stadium and even on billboards on punt road! That major sponsorship deal over five years placed Crypto.com as the Official Cryptocurrency Trading Platform of the AFL and AFLW, worth a reported $25 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Crypto.com is a Singapore based cryptocurrency exchange.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further embedding Crypto into the AFL landscape, AFL CEO Gillan McLachlan revealed the AFL has partnered with Animoca Brands to release NFT’s, non-fungible tokens, in a unique deal that will share revenue with the AFL Players Association. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animoca Brands was once listed on the ASX, now based in Hong Kong, is one of the world&#8217;s leading blockchain gaming NFT studios, worth more than US$5 billion. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During my 12-year professional AFL sporting career with the Hawthorn Hawks, we had many and varied corporate partners. An internet provider, health care provider, car brand and even a State Government just to name a few &#8211; not to mention the obligatory footwear / apparel sponsor. All brands were and still are prevalent corporations within their respective industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin, least of all Crypto Assets, to most during my career, were nothing more than a meme, or perceived fad. Now the services that allow you to buy and trade these assets sit amongst the major sponsors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this new financial world encroaches further into traditional finance, ironically NAB, one of the AFL’s longest standing sponsors, was also advertising around the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discussion around Cryptocurrency has intensified and can no longer be dismissed. The stability and long-term success of crypto assets is some way from being determined, yet the adoption of crypto assets by traditional financial institutions and even nation states, must be acknowledged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonwealth Bank Australia announced in November last year, ‘that it will become Australia’s first bank to offer customers the ability to buy, sell and hold crypto assets, directly through the CommBank app.’</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a few weeks ago, reported in the Australian Financial Review, ANZ ‘has minted a digital asset linked to the value of the Australian dollar,’ otherwise known as a stable coin. Adoption by these financial institutions suggests others will soon follow suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, Crypto.com is making a huge splash to lift their profile. Most notably, via a reported $700 million deal to rename the Staples Centre, home of LeBron James’ LA Lakers, Crypto.com Arena.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto.com has sponsored teams and leagues within soccer, hockey, and mixed martial arts, among a slew of sponsorship deals within the sporting landscape, Further, the platform has also committed to a campaign with Matt Damon – for a reported $100 million. All in an attempt to attract the eyeballs of an ever-growing, affluent youth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s not just Crypto.com ramping up their marketing budget in an attempt to onboard new users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance, the world’s largest Crypto exchange by trading volume, caught the global music industry’s attention when they recently signed a partnership agreement for the 64th GRAMMY Awards. Only a few days prior to that announcement, Binance purchased a $200 million stake in Forbes magazine, also taking  two of the nine seats on their board of directors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Binance.US, the United States partner company, secured $200 million in seed financing at a $4.5 billion pre-money valuation.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst we have mentioned both crypto.com and Binance, when it comes to sponsorship expenditure, FTX must take pole position. FTX, the fastest growing crypto currency exchange over the past three years, now valued at $32 billion, have now partnered with NFL legend Tom Brady and his supermodel wife, Gisele Bundchen. According to the company&#8217;s press release, the couple will work as ambassadors for equity in the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX has also inked deals with the Miami Heat, Major League Baseball and the Mercedes Formula One team, as we saw recently watching the Melbourne Grand Prix. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might ask why these sponsorship examples I have noted are all crypto exchanges? The 2 most significant reasons are that these exchanges are the bridge for the masses to gain crypto exposure. And in doing so, naturally the exchanges take a small clip of those transactions. Furthermore, these are centralised exchanges. Profits are held by the company to then redistribute, in part, to further sponsorship. The examples cited above gives you some indication of the amount of money flowing through these exchanges. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These large sporting brands and identities partnering with Crypto businesses, must first gain an understanding and level of trust in regards to the crypto landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A landscape that is developing quickly, both through a wealth creation, and adoption lens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently when I contacted Western Bulldogs CEO Ameet Bains, he admitted there was some initial trepidation given his lack of understanding of the Crypto industry. He was promptly reassured by his directors and advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial CoinSpot sponsorship deal was extended beyond the 1 year term to now represent 3 years and to further include their AFLW team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, Ameet is most excited about the advancements of blockchain and the opportunity to engage with the Western Bulldogs community via NFT’s and membership deals.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This merger between the new financial world and the old shall catch many off guard. More so, it’s the rate of change that shall surprise most. Given the AFL industry accepted Crypto centric sponsorship dollars for the first time last year, I wonder to what extent does the AFL understand this has the ability to cannibalise and create conflict with one of their longest standing partners, NAB. Perhaps this notion of the inevitability of crypto asset adoption has already been considered. Those who embrace the new asset class, such as the AFL, will have a head start on those who are hesitant. Only time will tell.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Blockchain Australia event a few weeks back, NAB executive, innovation and partnerships Howard Silby, said “banks are starting to have a mainstream blockchain moment”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These comments were made off the back of it being noted that NAB, alongside UBS, Standard Chartered &amp; BNP Paribas among others, has begun developing its own stablecoin to help settle trades on its carbon credit platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given NABs’ sponsorship of the AFL, and the possible collision course of the emerging and traditional financial systems, does that jeopardise the sponsorship money the AFL is set to receive?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, does this merely signal what is happening more broadly within society? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 years ago, crypto to the majority, was a meme. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the largest sporting brands and the highest profiled individuals around the world, are comfortable to partner with Crypto exchanges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this rate of change and adoption, where will crypto sit within our mindset in another 4 years time?</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket Network is quickly establishing itself as a core part of Crypto and Web3 infrastructure. Before Pocket Network, the builders of decentralised applications (dApps) and wallet providers had no choice but to use centralised providers for critical infrastructure services. The infrastructure service that Pocket Network provides can simply be described as ‘fetching real-time data from a blockchain’. DApps, users, and wallet providers can now opt out of using a centralised provider like Infura for this real-time data and instead use Pocket Network’s decentralised network of node operators. The benefits of this decentralised alternative will be explained throughout this post. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Centralisation Problem</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As active investors in crypto assets, we are constantly looking for decentralised solutions to the problems that centralisation can cause. The current sector, Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), has been dominated by a centralised entity called Infura for the past five years and is ripe for disruption. Infura, a subsidiary of the blockchain technology solutions conglomerate ConsenSys, provides developers with the tools and infrastructure to alleviate the burden of running their own ‘data feeding’ tools so that they can instead focus on building their applications. The most popular crypto asset wallet, Metamask, is another product in ConsenSys’ product suite. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Infura has played a vital role in enabling the development and function of DAaps on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms, it has encountered several issues over the past 24 months. These issues include several outages due to the increasing demand for bandwidth across blockchain ecosystems, and their involvement in censoring certain users from accessing their Metamask wallets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2020, Infura lagged behind the rest of the Ethereum node network by not updating to the latest node client and subsequently suffered a significant outage. This shouldn’t have even come close to impacting the wider network; however, because of Infra’s scale and importance, the event </span><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/84232/ethereum-infrastructure-provider-infura-is-down"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caused the Ethereum blockchain to fork</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a result, forked exchanges halted deposits/withdrawals, and the popular wallet, MetaMask, could not be used. While the issue was resolved without any lasting problems, it highlighted some of the issues surrounding Ethereum’s overdependence on large centralised infrastructure services providers such as Infura. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infura and Metamask also came under fire in March of this year when they accidentally blocked Venezuelan users from accessing their digital wallets. The outage of these wallets occurred when Infura changed specific settings too broadly by applying certain geoblocks after the US had announced new sanctions due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The Venezuelan geoblocks were accidentally included in these setting updates leaving many Venezuelan users locked out of their digital wallets. Events like these draw attention to the flaws of a centralised service provider and the tremendous power that Infura possesses in the IaaS market. We believe dAaps and their smart contract builders will elect to utilise products that can offer 100% uptime and censorship-resistant solutions within the IaaS space. These are two features that are core to Pocket Network’s value proposition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Pocket Network Explainer</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket Network is a blockchain data ecosystem for Web3 applications. It is a platform built for applications that use cost effective economies to coordinate and distribute data at scale. Today, the Pocket Network distributes data feeds to numerous dApps across 40 networks, including Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Algorand, and Harmony. These data feeds are vital to the functionality of the dApps. They include any relevant information on a blockchain a certain dApp may require. For example, MyCrypto, a crypto asset wallet provider, will use Pocket Network to retrieve token prices, ticker symbols, contract addresses, gas prices, and other data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket Network’s tokenomics and consensus mechanisms are based on a Proof-of-Stake model, ensuring the data it relays is decentralised, and node operators are sufficiently incentivised. Today it has approximately 40,000+ nodes, which compute an average of 3 billion weekly relays to dApps across 40 networks seamlessly and securely. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Apollo Investment</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the fork caused by Infura in November 2020, we first spoke with Pocket Network Co-Founder and CEO, Michael O’Rourke, in January 2021. At that time, the network had averaged 23.25 million relays each week for the previous month and there were less than 1000 nodes on the network. In contrast, Infura was processing around 2 billion relays/API calls per day. Pocket Network had been quietly in development for over three years before we first spoke to the team. On the surface, it was hard to see the progress made over these 3 years due to the relatively low relays/API calls. However, after digging deeper, it was clear to us that Pocket Network had the potential to really shake up the sector. In February 2021, we proceeded to buy POKT tokens directly from the Pocket Network team for US$0.12 each, subject to a 12-month lock-up. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1407 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-1024x683.png" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-300x200.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-768x512.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-600x400.png 600w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following our investment, Pocket Network continued to be relatively underutilised and not very well known for a number of months. However, the network started to see increased traction and utilisation in Q4 2021 as the team added support for alternative Layer 1 chains such as Solana, Avalanche, Algorand and </span><a href="https://docs.pokt.network/home/resources/references/supported-blockchains"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the four weeks from 22-2-2022 to 24-3-2022, the Pocket Network averaged 1.738 billion relays per week with 37,820 nodes participating in the network. This represents a 74.75 times increase in weekly relays from 14 months earlier.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the middle of January 2022, the POKT token began trading on popular centralised exchanges; naturally this added to the excitement and hype surrounding the protocol. While the price chart below may not look favourable, the current valuation of POKT is an impressive US$918 million and significantly higher than our US$0.12 entry price. After seeing the network gain a level of traction, we directly purchased an additional tranche of POKT in December 2021 and began setting up staked nodes to increase our support for the network. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1409 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-1024x862.png" alt="" width="750" height="631" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-1024x862.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-300x253.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-768x647.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1.png 1179w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Apollo Node Operations </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operating a Pocket Network node requires a certain amount of POKT to be staked and a reasonable level of maintenance even with automation. In return for operating these nodes, we are rewarded with additional POKT in the form of both inflationary rewards and rewards driven by underlying network activity. Inflationary rewards refers to newly minted POKT; this increases the circulating supply of POKT and can have a negative impact on price if demand remains equal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our nodes currently represent 0.41% of the total network, this strategy is estimated to be generating a variable yield of around 100% APR on our total POKT staked. Apart from the minimum capital requirements, the main barrier to entry for running a node is the actual setting up of the nodes. We have leaned on the expertise of our in-house developer to activate and maintain these nodes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apollo Capital is proud to be supporting the Pocket Network as early investors and node runners. We are strong believers in the power of decentralisation and view Pocket Network as the key piece of the Web3 infrastructure required for blockchains to take another step towards complete decentralisation.   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Crypto Glossary Terms</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like in traditional finance, there is no shortage of crypto jargon that can make the average crypto newbie feel confused. Today we wanted to help define a few of these crypto native terms to educate readers. Unlike in the movie “The Big Short”, we were unfortunately unable to obtain A-list celebrities to explain these terms in exotic places.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Crypto Finance Terms</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMM &#8211; Automated Market Maker</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMM’s allow digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way by using liquidity pools rather than a &#8216;traditional market of &#8220;asks and bids&#8221;. AMM users supply liquidity pools with crypto assets. Other users can then enter those liquidity pools and swap one asset for another.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridging</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving crypto assets from one blockchain to another. This process usually involves locking the crypto asset on the original chain and then minting the equivalent on the destination chain. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CeFi</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centralised Finance &#8211; Refers to crypto finance that relies on third party intermediaries to function e.g. centralised exchanges and centralised lending platforms like BlockFi &amp; Nexo</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeFi </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralised Finance &#8211; Refers to a subset of crypto projects that aim to build financial applications on top of blockchains using smart contracts </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDP &#8211; Collateralised Debt Position</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CDP is created when an asset is borrowed (on Aave/ Compound) or minted (DAI, MIM) against funds locked in a smart contract. The value of the locked funds must be greater than the debt position.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flippening</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term ‘Flippening’ is given to a crypto asset that surpasses another crypto asset in market capitalisation terms. ‘Flippening’ is most commonly used to anticipate Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin in market capitalisation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas is the common term given to the amount of a native token used on smart contract platforms to buy and sell goods and services. Gas costs can be variable depending on the demand for the smart contract platform. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICO / IDO / IEO</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Initial DEX Offering (IDO) and Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) are names given to public fundraising rounds. They are the final round of raising a project team will perform before releasing their token to the market. ICOs are typically conducted privately with whitelisting of investors, whereas an IEO takes place on a centralised exchange and an IDO, on a permissionless decentralised exchange (DEX).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impermanent Loss (IL)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impermanent loss can occur when providing liquidity to an Automated Market Maker (AMM) due to the constant product function that liquidity pools utilise. As prices fluctuate, the total balance of each asset in the pool also changes, resulting in liquidity providers owning a different balance of coins compared to what they initially deposited. Impermanent loss is when this change in balance results in less returns than what could be achieved if the users just held the assets. It is “impermanent” because IL is mitigated if prices return back to what they were when the assets were deposited. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liquidity Pool</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Liquidity pool can be thought of as a pot of cryptocurrency assets locked within a smart contract, which can be used for exchanges, loans and other applications.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fork </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fork occurs when the rules of a blockchain are changed, possibly creating two (or more) distinct digital assets. This may result from an upgrade to the features of the blockchain, a bug in the consensus algorithm, or changes to the node software. Check out our blog post </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/forking-explained/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Forking Explained&#8217;.</span></a></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-signature, or multi-sig, is a feature of bitcoin and other digital assets that requires multiple private keys to sign a transaction and move funds. Practically speaking, multi-sig can be used to add an extra layer of security to digital asset transactions by requiring additional approval from a third party before a transaction is approved. Digital asset custodians typically use multi-sig wallets and processes to help secure client funds.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nodes are software that run on internet-connected computers and function as non-mining transaction validators and digital asset wallets. In Bitcoin, for example, full nodes download the entire blockchain and validate each transaction per the agreed-upon rules of the network and relay transactions and blocks to others.</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rollups</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rollups perform transaction execution outside layer one by “rolling up” or aggregating transactions, and then posting the data to layer one where consensus is reached. As transaction data is included in layer one blocks, rollups are secured by native base layer one security.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenomics</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenomics is the topic of understanding the supply and demand characteristics of crypto assets. Projects will have specific tokenomic designs to drive particular outcomes for their protocol. Circulating market capitalisation, fully diluted market capitalisation, airdrops, seed round fundraising, ICO/IDO and treasury are all items of consideration when designing a tokenomics model. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero-Knowledge Proof</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are an experimental technology that allow one to cryptographically prove a statement, without revealing the input data. For instance, one could prove that a transaction was included in the blockchain without telling you which transaction it is. This technology is currently being used in various layer two projects on Ethereum to enable Ethereum to scale appropriately in the future. </span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the course of 2021, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) in crypto has been a strong topic of conversation, particularly in the wake of bitcoin’s strong price movement and increase in global adoption. At Apollo Capital we pay strong attention to ESG within crypto and would like to address concerns over the possible negative externalities associated with ESG and crypto assets.</p>
<p>In this Research Report, we wish to put crypto’s Environmental narrative in a more balanced perspective. We also aim to highlight crypto and blockchain technology’s contribution towards Social and Governance factors. We showcase real-life examples of how crypto helps meet numerous UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), such as Innovation, Reducing Inequality, Gender Equality, Sustainable Community, Justice &amp; Strong Institutions. Furthermore, we want to highlight the positive implications of crypto in the social and governance aspects of ESG – which actively work towards meeting the UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this Research Report. Please feel free to share it with others you think might be interested, and we look forward to bringing you more Research Reports in future.</p>
