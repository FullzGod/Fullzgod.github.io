										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto asset market is experiencing the most turbulent times in the market’s history. Various large centralised institutions are becoming insolvent, with each week passing more news comes to light of trouble market players. In this article, we will outline how these centralised entities have harmed the market through excessive risk-taking behaviour performed in a non-transparent fashion. We will then look at how transparent DeFi protocols have performed throughout these volatile times providing examples with crypto assets held by Apollo Capital, showcasing their consistent market demand through generating consistent cash flows for liquidity providers and token holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Centralised Finance (CeFi) Troubles</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celsius is a CeFi platform that offered investors lucrative interest rates on their crypto assets held on the platform. The business was founded in 2017 and enjoyed explosive growth in the years that followed due to their widespread marketing and general ease of use for retail investors.</span><a href="https://celsius.network/about-us"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">According to their website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Celsius was managing US$11.82 billion in assets (17 May 2022) and had processed US$8.2 billion in loans, making them an important crypto market participant for many years.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1512 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--1024x753.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="552" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--1024x753.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--300x221.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--768x565.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius-.jpg 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Celsius&#8217;s Announcement to their Users on the 12th of June 2022</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On 12 June 2022, Celsius announced that it was suspending “all withdrawals, swaps and transfers between accounts”. The freezing of customers&#8217; assets caught many users off guard, as they viewed Celsius as a reliable and safe way to store their crypto assets as advertised on their social media, website and via referral partners. Also portrayed in their messaging were their safe and reliable yield generating practices which lead users to believed Celsius generated the yield for their customers through direct crypto lending and conservative DeFi practices. In reality, they were undertaking riskier business practices to earn this yield, with no transparency on their procedures and strategies. Some mainstream media outlets have previously labelled Celsius as a DeFi platform along with the various referral partners on social media. However, this was simply not the case &#8211; as DeFi protocols provide complete transparency and on-chain verification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Celsius platform, user deposits are treated as a liability on the balance sheet, similar to a bank. The platform’s underlying profitability depends on its ability to take these deposits and earn a higher yield than they are required to pay depositors. With insufficient demand from the market for direct crypto loans, CeFi platforms allocate their assets into DeFi protocols and staking to meet their yield targets. The key events that led to the insolvency of Celsius included losing 38,000 ETH to the platform ‘Stakehound’, losing US$54 million in the Badger DAO hack, general liquidity requirements mismanagement and large user withdrawals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the full extent of the Celsius collapse is yet to be realised, it is the everyday user who suffers due to the risk-taking behaviour of a centralised entity. While hacks in DeFi can also be devastating for retail users, CeFi platforms have long engaged in marketing tactics that entice less sophisticated investors to utilise their products and carry the risk. </span></p>
<p><b>Risky Lending Practices &#8211; Three Arrows Capital (3AC)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before its insolvency, Three Arrows Capital was a proprietary trading firm that earned a considerable reputation in the crypto market by making concentrated bets and securing enormous profits. They were highly sought after VC style investors in the primary markets and amassed US$10-15 billion in assets throughout the bull market. Their downfall was catalysed by enormous losses from the collapse of LUNA and the following broader market sell off. It is rumoured that 3AC’s debt could amount to around US$1 billion, with the flow on effects likely to have a lasting impact on both retail and institutional investors alike.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder of Three Arrows Capital, Zhu Su broke his Twitter silence with this tweet on the 15th of June.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1521 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--1024x516.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="378" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--1024x516.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--300x151.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--768x387.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su-.jpg 1166w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3AC used their reputation to gain under-collateralised credit lines from risk seeking centralised lenders who were fiercely competing with each other, leading to irresponsible lending practices. It is reasonable to assume that many of these lenders would not have had a clear view into the balance sheet of 3AC. Whether that was through ignorance, fraud or a mixture of both, is up for speculation. The transparency offered by decentralised finance poses a stark contrast to these centralised entities. Smart contract enabled financial applications do not distinguish between users’ reputations,  they are transparent pieces of code that simply keep functioning, day after day. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MakerDAO &amp; DAI</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MakerDAO is a great example of stability in the DeFi ecosystem despite the current market conditions and volatility caused by centralised entities and poorly designed crypto assets. After the Luna / UST collapse, one of our analysts spoke of the importance of MakerDAO and its over collateralised stablecoin DAI in an</span><a href="https://stockhead.com.au/cryptocurrency/apollos-moonshots-strength-in-maker-convex-opportunity-and-luna-crash-silver-linings/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">interview with Stockhead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. MakerDAO has demonstrated the importance of decentralisation and thoughtful design in peer-to-peer networks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can ‘mint’ DAI against the crypto asset collateral they choose to deposit into the protocol’s smart contracts. The amount of DAI minted by the user becomes a debt, repaying this debt by ‘burning’ the minted DAI plus interest unlocks this deposited collateral. DAI is pegged to the US dollar and is considered to be the most decentralised over-collateralised stablecoin. The decentralised aspect of DAI is an important reason that MakerDAO has been able to survive these market conditions and continues to flourish. The main reason for DAI’s decentralisation is because the collateral used to mint DAI are primarily the most decentralised crypto assets like ETH and BTC with the only requirement for a user to mint DAI being a crypto wallet, with no KYC needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minimum collateral ratio that users are able to borrow for certain asset types is 130%, meaning if the user wanted to borrow 10,000 DAI, they must collateralise their position with at least $13,000 worth of ETH. Also known as the liquidation ratio, if the collateralised value drops below this number, the borrower will be subject to partial liquidation to cover outstanding debt, this comes with a liquidation fee of 13%. Due to MakerDAO&#8217;s transparency and being able to view all data on the blockchain, investors do not have to worry about misleading and unethical behaviour that stems from centralised entities who have hidden information from users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Stability, Total Value Locked, Revenue, On-Chain Statistics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the recent turmoil and volatility in the crypto markets, the DAI token has proven itself as a truly stable and trustworthy stablecoin. DAI uses what is known as a Peg-Stability Module (PSM) to ensure it has a 1:1 valuation with the US Dollar. The Peg Stability Module allows users to swap a given collateral type directly for DAI at a fixed rate, rather than borrowing DAI. The PSM contract allows users to swap other stablecoins such as USDC for DAI, making DAI’s peg very stable as any variation in the price can be arbitraged. The transparency and stability achieved through the implementation and reiteration of the protocol’s design over several years is a testament to the ultimate goal of Decentralised Finance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are able to look at other stablecoins such as UST and USDT when comparing the stability of DAI’s peg. However, DAI is the only decentralised stablecoin backed by on-chain crypto, which strengthens the support of its peg. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MakerDAO is currently trading at $1020 with a market cap of $1 billion and total value locked (TVL) of approximately $7.9 billion, which accounts for over 10% of the TVL in the entire DeFi space. The amount of BTC locked in the protocol is at an all time high with approximately 68,000 BTC locked (wrapped BTC on the Ethereum blockchain). With market conditions forcing some centralised companies into insolvency, MakerDAO has generated an annual total revenue of $34.9 million, and is one of the highest grossing DeFi protocols.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Aave</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aave is a highly renowned DeFi money market where users can supply and borrow crypto assets at an interest rate determined by the supply and demand of funds in the protocol. Aave is another major DeFi protocol that has survived the test of time while centralised lenders have caused disruption and uncertainty in the market. Aave is available across many layer one ecosystems such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Artbitrum, Harmony and layer twos such as Arbitrum and Optimism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the over-collateralisation mechanics of the Aave lending market as well as the community’s careful approach to only enabling highly decentralised and ‘safe’ crypto assets, there has never been a default case or ‘bad debt’ on the platform. The trust and stability of Aave are evident through its growth in user volume to $9.74 billion of liquidity locked across 7 networks and over 13 markets. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1522 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--1024x558.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="409" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--1024x558.jpeg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--300x163.jpeg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--768x418.jpeg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms-.jpeg 1484w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Aave &#8211; TVL, Revenue, On-Chain statistics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aave has implemented many risk parameters to ensure the stability of the protocol. When market conditions change, risks change. Specific parameters include the loan to value and liquidation thresholds related to the risk of each of the assets available in the Aave protocol. A liquidation in Aave occurs when a borrower&#8217;s collateral value is not properly covering their loan/debt value, thus the user&#8217;s health factor falls below 1. To prevent these types of liquidations, Aave users are able to over-collateralise so that they can cover their debt and reduce the risk of their assets falling below their liquidation level. This has limited the number of liquidations that have occurred on the protocol and has encouraged more users to safely borrow on the protocol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the number of liquidations that have occurred on Aave’s protocol has totalled $24.2m. This number is very small compared to the total liquidation value this year of over $2 billion. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lending Market Liquidations</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1524" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="774" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI.jpg 1290w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1290px) 100vw, 1290px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAVE is currently trading at $66.30 and has a market cap of around $920m with a Total Value Locked of approximately $6.75 billion, the second highest TVL out of any protocol in the DeFi sector. The lending protocol also has an annualised total revenue of $68.6m, which the majority is distributed to the lenders on the protocol who earn interest on the capital they lend. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Uniswap</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap is the leading decentralised exchange (DEX) in DeFi. Unlike centralised exchanges and entities, Uniswaps transactions are all stored in the blockchain and are available for everyone to see &#8211; displaying their transparency and trust with its community. Using smart contract interactions, the protocol facilitates automated transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol supports thousands of digital assets and stable coins across the Ethereum ecosystem and is crucial for the stability of the DeFi sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap recently surpassed $1 trillion in lifetime transaction volume, more than any other decentralised exchange. Uniswap liquidity providers earn a percentage of the transaction fees which incentivises them to provide liquidity &#8211; which is an example of the community engagement that is supported by decentralised entities. Despite the recent downdraws in the global markets, the transaction volume on Uniswap continues to rise and many new users are interacting with the protocol. </span></p>
<p><b>Uniswap &#8211; TVL, Revenue, On-Chains statistics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap reached an all time high valuation of $45 in May of 2021. It is currently trading at $5.68 and has a fully diluted market cap of around $5.14 billion. The TVL in Uniswap is approximately $5 billion , making it the 4th largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL. Uniswaps exchange has generated an annualised total revenue of $750 million, making it the highest grossing DeFi protocol, with most of the revenue distributed to liquidity providers. The total revenue generated by the exchange is up 65.3% for the year, which illustrates the protocol&#8217;s stability and importance compared to many other centralised exchanges.</span></p>

<p><b>Monthly DeFi revenue</b></p>
<p><b> </b><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1523 size-full" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1.jpg" alt="" width="2401" height="1260" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1.jpg 2401w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-1536x806.jpg 1536w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-2048x1075.jpg 2048w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Defi-revenue-1-1568x823.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2401px) 100vw, 2401px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global financial markets continue to shake the digital asset class and challenge the stability of the decentralised financial sector. However top protocols such as MakerDao, AAVE and Uniswap have proven that they can be successful and perform well despite the turmoil caused and exhibited by centralised entities. These are just a few of the top decentralised applications that continue to generate positive cash flows in a transparent manner for token holders and users. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading wealth management industry participant, Apollo Capital has joined the ranks of an elite global group who have been handed the honour of winning a WealthBriefing Award.</p>
<p>Apollo Capital was awarded ‘<strong>Best Digital Assets Offering (South-East Asia)</strong>’ at the <strong>Tenth Annual WealthBriefing Asia Awards 2022</strong>.</p>
<p>Showcasing ‘best of breed’ in the Asia region, the awards have been designed to recognise outstanding organisations grouped by specialism and geography which the prestigious panel of independent judges deemed to have ‘demonstrated innovation and excellence during the last year’.</p>
<p>Each of these categories is highly contested and is subject to a rigorous process before the ultimate winner is selected by the judges. It is this process that makes WealthBriefing awards so prized amongst winners.</p>
<p>The WealthBriefringAsia Awards are part of a global programme run by WealthBriefingAsia and its sister publications WealthBriefing and Family Wealth Report, encompassing all of the world’s major wealth management centres.</p>
<p>Participants around the world recognise that winning awards is particularly important in these challenging times as it gives clients a reassurance in the solidity and sustainability of the winner’s business and operating model.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting on the firm’s triumph, Henrik Andersson, CIO, Apollo Capital said:</strong> &#8220;We are delighted to be recognised in this award from WealthBriefing Asia. We at Apollo Capital have worked incredibly hard since our founding nearly four and half years ago, to stand by our tagline and bring ‘Institutional Asset Management to a New Asset Class.’ We are thrilled to have received this award, in recognition of our efforts and strong performance delivered to investors. Since expanding to Singapore nearly 12 months ago, we have been delighted with the reception from the Asian markets and continue to be impressed by their enthusiasm to learn about and invest in crypto assets.”</p>
<p><strong>ClearView Financial Media’s CEO, and Publisher of WealthBriefing, Stephen Harris, was the first to extend his congratulations to all the winners. He said:</strong> “The organisations and individuals who triumphed in these awards are all worthy winners, and I would like to extend my heartiest congratulations to the winners and to those who have put so much work into each winning submission.</p>
<p>“It is clear that the judges valued and recognised Apollo Capital’s strong performance and approach to investing in crypto assets. These awards were independently and expertly judged solely on the basis of entrants’ submissions and their responses to a number of specific questions, which were answered by focusing on the client experience rather than purely quantitative performance metrics. That is unique, and I believe, compelling feature. These awards recognise the very best operators in Asia wealth management, with ‘independence’, ‘integrity’ and ‘genuine insight’ the watchwords of the judging process &#8211; such that the awards truly reflect excellence in Asia wealth management.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s article will build on our previous article, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span></i><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/defi-tvl-boom/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeFi Total Value Locked Boom</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from September 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have witnessed considerable change in the global macroeconomic environment and crypto ecosystem during this time. These broader changes have harmed DeFi TVL. However, the fundamentals of what makes a strong DeFi ecosystem in the long term have not varied.</span></p>
<p><b>Fundamentals of Strong DeFi Ecosystems</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few key fundamentals contribute to an ecosystem&#8217;s strength and success in the DeFi sector. The first attribute of a vibrant DeFi ecosystem is a Decentralised Exchange (DEX) with high liquidity and high Total Value Locked (TVL). Traditionally successful DEXs will also have native tokens to incentivise liquidity. The largest DEXs in the market today are Uniswap and Curve. These protocols incentivise users to provide the automated market maker with liquidity for transaction fees and tokens &#8211; a current strategy we implement in our ACOF is allocating capital to the </span><a href="https://curve.fi/musd/deposit">Curve mUSD pool</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to earn an annual yield of 7.84%. For an in-depth description and demo of how DEXs operate, please refer to our </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHxgK2gDzcs&amp;t=3s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;DeFi Explained&#8217;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video covering the DEX SushiSwap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second ingredient to a thriving DeFi blockchain is to have strong, decentralised money markets (borrowing and lending protocols) that are trustworthy and reliable. Trust and reliability are commonly measured in the TVL the platforms can garner. Users feel more comfortable interacting and depositing capital into protocols that have become battle-hardened through time in the market and those that have undergone excessive code audits. Protocols that hit this profile are Aave and Compound. They are considered the most trusted protocols in this DeFi category and span multiple blockchains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last fundamental contributor to a flourishing DeFi ecosystem is the incentive programs and strategic marketing. Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche are all crypto assets held by Apollo Capital and have had their growth catalysed by large scale incentive programs targeting both developers and users. These incentive programs allocate the blockchain&#8217;s native token to protocols and yield farmers to promote TVL growth and development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we can see Avalanche is running an incentive program on one of the largest and most trusted money market protocols, AAVE. In addition, the interest in the token a DeFi user can earn supplying it. The user can also earn wrapped AVAX as a reward for utilising the AAVE.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1467 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--1024x645.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="472" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--1024x645.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--768x484.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--1536x968.jpg 1536w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example--1568x988.jpg 1568w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-example-.jpg 1696w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without well-established decentralised exchanges and money market protocols, blockchains will naturally have a lower TVL than other ecosystems. Algorand is another asset held by Apollo Capital with a relatively low TVL compared to another layer one chain with its decentralised money market, AlgoFi and decentralised exchange Tinyman, both still in their infancy. However, smaller ecosystems in the top 100 crypto assets such as Alogrand have the potential to increase if their dApps gain traction and strategic liquidity incentives are initiated. Ecosystems such as Solana, Avalanche and Polygon covered in this article make fantastic examples of TVL growth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Current TVL in Crypto 2022</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TVL in decentralised finance (DeFi) is currently at its lowest point in 2022. TVL has dropped from over $240B in January to around $107.6B today (-55%). This decline is due to crypto and macroeconomic factors. Luna&#8217;s failure has brought the public&#8217;s attention to DeFi. The world witnessed a $30B TVL loss in Luna&#8217;s ecosystem and represented a large proportion of TVL in DeFi. This recent event has shaken the whole DeFi sector, so we have seen recent reductions in TVL of most layer one ecosystems. Decreasing token price locked up contributes to a decrease in TVL, and the crypto market&#8217;s current correlation to the broader equities markets has also been another contributor. By the end of April 2022, the S&amp;P 500 recorded a loss of 13.8%, its worst start to the year since World War II. This negative sentiment generated from the federal reserve rate hikes and global supply constraints flowed into DeFi asset valuations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This graph illustrates the adoption of DeFi before the onset of adverse macroeconomic factors at the beginning of 2022 and the collapse of Luna (Terra) in early May 2022. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Total Value Locked in Ethereum</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum is the market leader in DeFi ecosystems. It has the largest TVL as well as the most </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/developer-activity-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developer activity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the original, most decentralised and secure smart contract platform, it has the most trust amongst DeFi users. With a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TVL of $69.7B, its dominance stands at almost 65% of the total TVL in DeFi. MakerDao (MKR), built on the Ethereum network, is the largest DeFi project with a current TVL of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $9.5B (8.75% dominance in the DeFi sector ) from a high of $18B at the beginning of 2022. MakerDao is Ethereum&#8217;s largest money market, allowing for lending and borrowing of digital assets. MakerDao is also the protocol behind the most decentralised over-collateralised stablecoin DAI. Ethereum also supports the leading decentralised exchange (DEX) in DeFi, Uniswap, which currently has a TVL of $5.55B and has recently surpassed $1 trillion in transaction volume. Ethereum is the well-established market leader in DeFi it is not as reliant on incentive programs to entice more TVL.</span></p>
<p><b>Key Statistics</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Represents 65% of TVL in Defi. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The network supports the largest DeFi project and money market (MakerDao) and the largest DEX (Uniswap). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, $69.7B TVL in Ethereum, reaching an annual high of $150B at the start of January 2022. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1459" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ethereum-Ecosystem.jpg" alt="" width="852" height="415" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ethereum-Ecosystem.jpg 852w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ethereum-Ecosystem-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ethereum-Ecosystem-768x374.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Total Value Locked in Binance Smart Chain </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a layer one blockchain built for easy and secure smart contract applications. Running alongside Binance Chain, BSC is </span><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">meaning that the codes developers use can function and execute smart contracts as they would on Ethereum </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enables developers to develop and use various decentralised applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Binance Smart Chain is currently the second-largest ecosystem for TVL in its DeFi sector &#8211; with a current TVL of $8.6B, making up 8.0% of the total TVL in DeFi. Binance Smart Chain&#8217;s leading protocol is PancakeSwap, a widely trusted DEX that accounts for over 46% of the network&#8217;s TVL. PancakeSwap is currently the second-largest DEX in the entire DeFi space and is a significant reason BSC has had a successful start in decentralised finance. Venus Protocol is BSC&#8217;s largest and most trusted money market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that enables lending, borrowing, and credit on digital assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; TVL of $817.5M. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance also dedicated $1B to growth the Binance Smart Chain in October 2021, with $100M allocated to developing and supporting DeFi protocols. Another clever method Binance utilises to help increase the price of their native token BNB and, in turn, increase TVL is to decrease the supply of BNB every quarter via a token burn. The token burn will stop once the total supply reaches 100,000,000 BNB (currently 163,276,974).</span></p>
<p><b>Key Statistics</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounts for 8.0% of TVL in DeFi. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PancakeSwap is the second-largest DEX in crypto after Uniswap. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venus Protocol (XVS) is BSC&#8217;s largest money market. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, $8.6B TVL in Solana, reaching an annual high of $17.4B at the beginning of January 2022. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significant amounts of BNB are removed (burnt) each quarter. </span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Total Value Locked in Avalanche</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avalanche is a top tier Proof-of-Stake (PoS) smart contract protocol and is currently ranked #4 for largest TVL. Avalanche&#8217;s native token AVAX has been a top performer in the flagship Ap</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ollo Capital Fund. It now has a TVL of $4.2B and TVL dominance of 3.8% in the DeFi sector. Avalanche allows users or projects who stake their AVAX token to create their own layer one or layer two blockchains validated by subnets (set of validators). This feature allows Avalanche to be compatible with Ethereum, allowing developers to easily port their Ethereum dApps to an independent Avalanche subnet to gain control over its security and function. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum DeFi protocols currently supported by Avalanche include the lending protocol AAVE, Curve and Sushiswap. TraderJoe is the second-largest protocol on Avalanche in terms of TVL ($400M TVL), which is an exclusive DEX to the blockc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hain. The most extensive protocol on Avalanche in terms of TVL is AAVE V3, the ecosystem leading money market used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earn interest in supplying and borrowing digital assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. AAVE is a highly renowned DeFi money market available on layer ones such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Artbitrum, Harmony and layer twos such as Arbitrum and Optimism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Avalanche Foundation DeFi incentive announcement was one of the first major DeFi incentive programs the industry experienced. We can see the TVL that flowed in, confirming it as one of the most successful incentive programs in 2021.</span></p>
<p><b>Key Statistics</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounts for 3.6% of TVL in DeFi. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compatible with Ethereum dApps through unique subnet integration. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, $3.9B TVL in Avalanche, reaching an annual high of $11.7B at the start of January 2022. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large fund allocations from Avalanche Foundation for DeFi incentives and subnet growth.</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Total Value Locked in Solana </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana is a high speed, low-cost layer one blockchain that supports smart contract interactions for decentralised applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In regards to TVL size, Solana is currently ranked 5th &#8211; with a TVL of $3.8B and TVL dominance of 3.5%. Solanas&#8217;s low transaction costs and scalability solution make it an excellent alternative for those wanting to farm on a chain other than Ethereum. Solana&#8217;s top TVL project is Solend, a trusted money market used for lending and borrowing assets, contributing 13.65% of the TVL on Solana&#8217;s network. Serum (SRM) is Solanas&#8217;s largest DEX in terms of TVL with a value of $292.5M, only slightly ahead of Raydium (RAY) &#8211; TVL $285.4M.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana has success as low-cost and ultra-fast has led to network outages, with the first significant outage occurring for 24 hours in September 2021. The chart shows the adverse reaction of a sharp ~34% decline in TVL to the network being halted for one day. There have since been more outages, which have harmed the ecosystem&#8217;s TVL. </span></p>
<p><b>Key Statistics</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounts for 3.5% of TVL in DeFi. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solend is Solanas&#8217;s leading money market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serum is leading DEX in Solana. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, $3.8B TVL in Solana, reaching an annual high of $11.6B at the start of January 2022. </span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Total Value Locked in Algorand </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algorand is currently one of the smaller up and coming ecosystems in the DeFi sector. It now has a total TVL of $126.9m, accounting for only 0.12% of TVL in DeFi. Algofi is the leading protocol in terms of TVL on Algorand, which is both the top money market and DEX on the network &#8211; current TVL is $82M. Alogrand&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">scalability, high performance and security provide innovative DeFi developers with an excellent opportunity to build the future of DeFi protocols on their blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is interesting to note that even where Algorand lacks in TVL size, it has made up for its consistent TVL growth. This could be attributed to the strategic Borderless Capital fund for Alogrand projects valued at $500M announced in December last year, highlighting the investment interest in projects launching on Algorand. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This investment by Borderless Capital spans across Alogrand&#8217;s largest dApps such as Algofi, Tinyman, Folks Finance and Pact, which are the top 4 applications on Algorand with TVLs between $14M and $84M. </span></p>

<p><b>The Future of Defi for the Remainder of 2022</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there have been recent drawdowns in the total value locked in DeFi, we still see new investors and development enter the space. DeFi is a highly regarded and essential financial service in the digital asset class. During the remainder of 2022, we expect new innovative DeFi projects to enter the space, whilst our favourite blue-chip assets mentioned throughout this article continue to build. TVL values in DeFi will most likely be unpredictable for the remainder of 2022. However, we at Apollo Capital are confident in the continual growth of developer activity in these various DeFi communities. DeFi has had two and a half years to mature into one of the essential verticals in the crypto industry completing. We look forward to investing, utilising and interacting with these protocols and chains moving into subsequent market cycles.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This article will cover developer activity&#8217;s fastest and largest growing smart contract ecosystems. Apollo Capital uses these metrics to help understand which ecosystems are the most collaborative, vibrant and committed to building long-lasting blockchains that can withstand the various crypto market cycles and external macroeconomic factors. </span></p>
<p>Below are the five largest smart contract platforms by total developers and a summary of their metrics. The y-axis indicates the average monthly Full-Time developers in 2021 and the x-axis indicates the average monthly Full-Time developers in 2020. All five of the largest ecosystems grew over the course of 2021.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1436 size-full" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222.png" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222.png 2000w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222-300x169.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222-768x432.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download222-1568x882.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum (ETH)</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum is the number one blockchain when looking into layer one developer activity. The network enables users and developers to interact with smart contracts, digital assets and decentralised finance applications. It is currently the leading chain regarding non-fungible token (NFT) volume and TVL in its decentralised finance sector. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over 4000 total monthly active developers</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Frontier for development in defi </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">42% increase of total monthly active developers from December 2020 to December 2021</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Polkadot (DOT)</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Polkadot is the second-largest layer one blockchain in regards to development activity. The network provides high energy efficiency, economic scalability, and an innovative opportunity for their parachain developers to gain complete control over the underlying blockchain instead of only via smart contracts. This unique feature allows for a more secure, faster and enhanced service across the entire ecosystem.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Approximately 1400 total monthly active developers</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">50% increase of total monthly active developers from December 2020 to December 2021</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solana (SOL)</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solana is a high speed, low-cost layer one blockchain that supports smart contract interactions for decentralised applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Solana&#8217;s security and scalability solution ensures the chain is censorship-resistant and transactions never exceed $0.01 per transaction. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Approximately 1000 total monthly active developers</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">385% increase of total monthly active developers from December 2020 to December 2021</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cosmos (ATOM) </span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cosmos is a decentralised ecosystem of blockchains with its solutions to problems, including scalability, usability and interoperability. The network makes blockchain development easy and powerful with high application scalability through its horizontal and vertical scalability solutions. Cosmos aims to break barriers between blockchains and allow them to communicate with each other in a decentralised way. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Approximately 1000 total monthly active developers</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">70% increase of total monthly active developers from December 2020 to December 2021</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bitcoin (BTC)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that uses peer to peer technology to eliminate central control. Bitcoin’s network is open-sourced and is used as a unique payment network with fast peer-to-peer transactions, low processing fees and security.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 650 <span data-preserver-spaces="true"> total monthly active developers</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10% <span data-preserver-spaces="true">increase of total monthly active developers from December 2020 to December 2021</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>The next graph we displayed shows a comparison of the top smart contract ecosystem&#8217;s total developer growth since their inception on the same scale as Ethereum. This graph is another way to visualise the developer&#8217;s activity growth rate and in fact, depicts Polkadot, Solana, Near, Avalanche, and BSC as all having faster initial growth in active developers than Ethereum did. Ethereum still leads the field as of December 2021, with a 280% lead in active monthly developers over its top competitor, Polkadot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zooming into the DeFi application level of crypto assets we can observe DeFi had a strong uptick in developer activity over the course of 2021 in the &#8216;blue-chip&#8217; DeFi protocols.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1442 size-full" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3.png" alt="" width="1207" height="541" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3.png 1207w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3-300x134.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3-1024x459.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DeFi-Protocols-3-768x344.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1207px) 100vw, 1207px" /></p>
<p>This graph gives the rate of change in the number of total decentralised finance (DeFi) developers from December 2020 to December 2021. Here we see some of the most reputable DeFi protocols, such as Balancer, Synthetix, Uniswap, Lido and Aave, all experience relatively significant increases in their growth in the DeFi sector. Balancer, Synthtix and Uniswap experienced a substantial shift in the number of Defi developers working on their protocols with an increase of over 100% in the one year. Lido and Aave also continued to grow in Defi development with increases of approximately 16% and 13%, respectively.</p>
<p>The developer engagement and its organic growth are some of the most essential fundamental metrics crypto asset investors will use when making investment decisions. The importance of these metrics is heightened in periods of downward and sideways price action in assets across the industry as it is these periods when the market is fearful when fragile ecosystems tend to decline in developer activity, whilst the strongest developer ecosystems remain robust through periods of uncertainty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Crypto Glossary Terms</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like in traditional finance, there is no shortage of crypto jargon that can make the average crypto newbie feel confused. Today we wanted to help define a few of these crypto native terms to educate readers. Unlike in the movie “The Big Short”, we were unfortunately unable to obtain A-list celebrities to explain these terms in exotic places.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Crypto Finance Terms</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMM &#8211; Automated Market Maker</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMM’s allow digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way by using liquidity pools rather than a &#8216;traditional market of &#8220;asks and bids&#8221;. AMM users supply liquidity pools with crypto assets. Other users can then enter those liquidity pools and swap one asset for another.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridging</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving crypto assets from one blockchain to another. This process usually involves locking the crypto asset on the original chain and then minting the equivalent on the destination chain. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CeFi</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centralised Finance &#8211; Refers to crypto finance that relies on third party intermediaries to function e.g. centralised exchanges and centralised lending platforms like BlockFi &amp; Nexo</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeFi </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralised Finance &#8211; Refers to a subset of crypto projects that aim to build financial applications on top of blockchains using smart contracts </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDP &#8211; Collateralised Debt Position</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CDP is created when an asset is borrowed (on Aave/ Compound) or minted (DAI, MIM) against funds locked in a smart contract. The value of the locked funds must be greater than the debt position.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flippening</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term ‘Flippening’ is given to a crypto asset that surpasses another crypto asset in market capitalisation terms. ‘Flippening’ is most commonly used to anticipate Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin in market capitalisation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas is the common term given to the amount of a native token used on smart contract platforms to buy and sell goods and services. Gas costs can be variable depending on the demand for the smart contract platform. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICO / IDO / IEO</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Initial DEX Offering (IDO) and Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) are names given to public fundraising rounds. They are the final round of raising a project team will perform before releasing their token to the market. ICOs are typically conducted privately with whitelisting of investors, whereas an IEO takes place on a centralised exchange and an IDO, on a permissionless decentralised exchange (DEX).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impermanent Loss (IL)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impermanent loss can occur when providing liquidity to an Automated Market Maker (AMM) due to the constant product function that liquidity pools utilise. As prices fluctuate, the total balance of each asset in the pool also changes, resulting in liquidity providers owning a different balance of coins compared to what they initially deposited. Impermanent loss is when this change in balance results in less returns than what could be achieved if the users just held the assets. It is “impermanent” because IL is mitigated if prices return back to what they were when the assets were deposited. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liquidity Pool</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Liquidity pool can be thought of as a pot of cryptocurrency assets locked within a smart contract, which can be used for exchanges, loans and other applications.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perpetual Futures (Perps)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crypto-native derivative contract pioneered by crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX. This contract uses an intra-day funding rate to push the derivative price towards the spot price. Long and short traders either pay the funding rate or get paid the funding rate depending on the difference between the spot price and the derivative’s price.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play-to-Earn (P2E)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play-to-Earn (P2E) refers to the concept of gaming in which a platform provides its players the chance to earn any form of in-game assets that can be transferred to crypto assets or liquidated into fiat as a tangible asset. Play-to-Earn was made most famous by the well-known blockchain game &#8216;Axie Infinity&#8217;. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slippage </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between the current/expected price of a trade and the executed price of a trade. Slippage can be a significant problem for AMM liquidity pools pool with low liquidity. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Funding Trade</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding trade is a derivatives strategy to take advantage of the Perpetual Future&#8217;s funding rate. Usually, this strategy involves shorting the Perpetual Future while holding the equivalent amount in spot in order to collect the funding rate paid by long traders of the Perpetual Future. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TradFi </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional Finance &#8211; Refers to legacy financial infrastructure and institutions such as Banks.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitelisting</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitelisting is the act of reserving the right to participate in a crypto investments or minting of an NFT for particular crypto addresses. The owners of these addresses may be required to perform certain activities such as KYC, answer questionnaires and promote projects on social media to achieve the whitelisting. Similar to a ‘Cap Table’ in traditional finance, a list of whitelisted addresses will be the addresses guaranteed an investment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yield Farming</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Moon&#8217; is a native to crypto term that signifies significant price appreciation. As you would imagine, it is used commonly in crypto discourse when there is bullish sentiment.

<p><b>Technical Terms</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fork </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fork occurs when the rules of a blockchain are changed, possibly creating two (or more) distinct digital assets. This may result from an upgrade to the features of the blockchain, a bug in the consensus algorithm, or changes to the node software. Check out our blog post </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/forking-explained/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Forking Explained&#8217;.</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-Sig or Multi-Signature</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-signature, or multi-sig, is a feature of bitcoin and other digital assets that requires multiple private keys to sign a transaction and move funds. Practically speaking, multi-sig can be used to add an extra layer of security to digital asset transactions by requiring additional approval from a third party before a transaction is approved. Digital asset custodians typically use multi-sig wallets and processes to help secure client funds.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Node</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nodes are software that run on internet-connected computers and function as non-mining transaction validators and digital asset wallets. In Bitcoin, for example, full nodes download the entire blockchain and validate each transaction per the agreed-upon rules of the network and relay transactions and blocks to others.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rollups</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rollups perform transaction execution outside layer one by “rolling up” or aggregating transactions, and then posting the data to layer one where consensus is reached. As transaction data is included in layer one blocks, rollups are secured by native base layer one security.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenomics</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenomics is the topic of understanding the supply and demand characteristics of crypto assets. Projects will have specific tokenomic designs to drive particular outcomes for their protocol. Circulating market capitalisation, fully diluted market capitalisation, airdrops, seed round fundraising, ICO/IDO and treasury are all items of consideration when designing a tokenomics model. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero-Knowledge Proof</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are an experimental technology that allow one to cryptographically prove a statement, without revealing the input data. For instance, one could prove that a transaction was included in the blockchain without telling you which transaction it is. This technology is currently being used in various layer two projects on Ethereum to enable Ethereum to scale appropriately in the future. </span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2021 was an incredible year for crypto with new all time highs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as many other assets. We also saw corporations and institutions support crypto like never before. The first Bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US and here in Australia we saw the country’s largest bank, CBA start offering crypto assets to their clients. If 2020 was the year of DeFi, 2021 saw a boom in the NFT market.</p>
<p>It’s incredibly hard to predict what will happen in the fast moving crypto markets, but here are my best bets for 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling</strong></p>
<p>2022 will be the year of scaling Ethereum. Together with alternative Layer 1s, my prediction is that Ethereum Layer 1 will become less than 50% of total DeFi TVL in 2022. By the end of 2022, the majority of TVL will be on Ethereum Layer 2s and alternative L1s. This would be a huge shift in the market, accelerated by the launch of L2 tokens on Arbitrum and Optimism. For the first time blockchains will be able to onboard 100s of millions of users.</p>
<p><strong>DeFi/Derivatives</strong></p>
<p>While the general market rallied in 2021, a surprising number of DeFi assets underperformed, some even posting negative fiat denominated returns for the full year. I think we will see a resurgence in DeFi assets in 2022 partly helped by scaling that will enable things like on-chain derivatives to a much larger extent. My prediction is for $1 trillion in DeFi TVL by the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Chain</strong></p>
<p>2021 was the year that cemented the thesis that we are moving into a multi-chain world. Infrastructure projects enabling this future, things like multi-chain DEXes and bridges will significantly increase in a value in 2022. My prediction is that we will see at least one of these multi-chain infrastructure projects enter the top 20 most valuable crypto assets.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Headwinds</strong></p>
<p>We didn’t see much regulatory developments in 2021. Perhaps the biggest development was the approval of the first Bitcoin ETF in the US (unfortunately futures based). My prediction is that we will see negative regulatory developments out of the US in 2022. Influential senators like Elizabeth Warren (who eg Ryan Selkis of Messari refers to as Satan) has recently expressed deeply flawed and negative bias against crypto. My hope is that any negative development out of the US will not spill over to the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Web3/Metaverse</strong></p>
<p>A mega-trend in 2021 was NFTs going mainstream. Currently, NFT are mostly used for art, collectibles and for in-game items. All these ares will continue to grow rapidly. Another potentially huge growth area of NFTs is the metaverse. My prediction is that we will see another mega corporation, the likes of a Google or Apple, follow Meta (formerly Facebook) and launch products/services to support metaverse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2021 Predictions Review </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>1</em></strong><em>. We will see the rise of Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. While there has been much talk about Ethereum 2.0, it is still years away in the sense of being useable for smart contracts. I believe we will see some big DeFi protocols move to L2 in 2021 accompanied by real volumes. I hope that the community will come to a consensus over which solution to use, be it Optimistic Rollups or something else, but that is probably wishing for too much.</em></p>
<p>We did see the launch of Ethereum L2s with support from mainstream protocols like Uniswap, Balancer, Synthetix etc. However we didn’t see significant TVL or usage on these L2 in 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.</strong> Coinbase will IPO on a major exchange such as the NYSE or Nasdaq. This event would bring a lot of attention to crypto and solidify Coinbase as the ‘Google’ (or is it IBM?) of crypto.</em></p>
<p>Coinbase did IPO in April of 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. </strong>Bitcoin will again see an all time high in 2021. My personal opinion is that Bitcoin could reach US$50,000-100,000 in this bull cycle. I believe this could happen in 2021.  Monetary policy will continue to pour cash into global economies throughout 2021 while the supply increase of Bitcoin has decreased to only 6.25 BTC per block or 1.7% supply inflation per year. This is a potent cocktail for the best performing asset in the world to continue to outperform.</em></p>
<p>This was spot on as Bitcoin hit an all time high above $68,000 in November of 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. </strong>We will see the rise of at least one trustless stablecoin. With trustless I mean a crypto backed stablecoin or an algorithmic stablecoin. I bet one of them will reach over 500M in market cap in 2021. </em></p>
<p>2021 was a huge year for trustless stablecoins. TerraUSD got 10bn in market cap, MIM 4.5 bn, Frax 1.9bn, Liquity USD 833M and Fei USD 762M. At Apollo, we continue to be mega-bullish trustless stablecoins.</p>
<p><em><strong>5.</strong> Finally, I predict Cardano will fall out of top 10 crypto assets as defined by Coingecko. While Cardano is a far superior crypto asset to a lot of other assets out there, the top 10 is still very inefficient and will continue to change dramatically over time. In the case of Layer 1 smart contract platforms, the competition is getting very intense and I’d be surprised if Cardano will stay in its current position.</em></p>
<p>Cardano didn’t fall out of top 10, currently sitting at spot number 7. According to DeFiLlama Cardano has the highest market cap to TVL of any blockchain. I think market cap will go down faster than they will gain TVL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By Henrik Andersson，Apollo Capital 首选投资官 CIO</p>
<p>对加密货币而言，2021年是不可思议的一年。比特币、以太坊及许多其他加密资产的价格都创下历史新高。我们还看到，企业和机构在前所未有地支持加密货币。第一个比特币相关的ETF在美国获得批准，并且澳大利亚最大的银行CBA开始向客户提供加密资产服务。如果说2020年是DeFi之年，那么2021年则见证了NFT市场的繁荣。</p>
<p>虽然很难预测瞬息万变的加密市场将会发生什么，但我还是尽我所能对2022年做出预测。</p>
<p><strong>扩展性</strong><br />
2022年将是以太坊扩展性大为发展的一年。我认为，在2022年，以太坊Layer 1在DeFi 上的总锁定价值（TVL）将降至50%以下。到2022年底，大部分TVL将会基于以太坊的Layer 2链和其他Layer 1 区块链。这将是市场的巨大转变，并且在Arbitrum和Optimism上推出Layer 2代币，会进一步推动这种变化。区块链也将首次搭载上亿用户。</p>
<p><strong>DeFi/衍生品</strong><br />
尽管整个加密市场在2021年上行，但大量DeFi资产的表现不及预期，甚至一些资产全年的法币计价回报表现为负收益。我认为，我们将在2022年看到DeFi资产的复苏，这在一定程度上得益于以太坊的扩展性，而扩展性将使链上衍生品等DeFi应用在更大程度上得以落地。</p>
<p>我的预测是，到今年年底，DeFi TVL将达到1万亿美元。</p>
<p><strong>多链</strong><br />
2021年论证了我们正进入多链世界的这一观点。而实现多链的基础设施项目，如多链DEX（去中心化交易所）和跨链桥等项目的价值将在2022年显著上升。</p>
<p>我的预测是，至少有一个多链基础设施项目将位列最具价值的20个加密资产。</p>
<p><strong>监管的不利因素</strong><br />
在2021年，监管方面并无显著进展。或许最大的进展便是，美国首支比特币相关ETF获批。但遗憾的是，这只是比特币期货的ETF，而不是真正的比特币ETF。</p>
<p>我的预测是，美国对加密资产的监管在2022年会更加苛刻。Elizabeth Warren等有影响力的参议员最近表达了对加密货币的偏见及不认可。我希望，美国的任何负面政策将来不会波及到世界其他地区。</p>
<p><strong>Web 3/元宇宙</strong><br />
NFT走向主流世界，这是2021年的一大趋势。目前，NFT主要用于艺术品、收藏品和游戏道具。所有这些领域将继续迅速发展。而NFT的另一个潜在的巨大增长领域则是元宇宙。</p>
<p>我的预测是，我们将看到另一家巨头企业（如谷歌或苹果等）会追随Meta（即脸书）的脚步，推出支持Meta的产品或服务。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>2021 Predictions Review</strong><br />
回顾2021年的预测，准确率高达 80%</p>
<p><strong>预测1：</strong>我们将看到以太坊Layer 2解决方案的崛起。虽然关于以太坊2.0的讨论已经很多了，但要真正用于智能合约的平台，还需要几年的时间。</p>
<p>我相信，在2021年，一些大型DeFi协议将迁移到多个Layer 2链上，并拥有真正的用户流量。我希望加密社区能够就使用哪种解决方案达成共识，如Optimistic Rollups抑或是其他，但我的期望可能太高了。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>在2021年，我们确实看到了在主流协议如Uniswap、Balancer、Synthetix等的支持下，多个以太坊Layer 2链面世了。然而，Layer 2链并未拥有大量的TVL，而且这些协议也没有应用在Layer 2上。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测2</strong>：Coinbase将在纽交所或纳斯达克等主流交易所上市。这一事件将引起人们对加密货币的大量关注，也将巩固Coinbase作为加密货币领域“谷歌”或“IBM”的地位。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>Coinbase的确于2021年4月份上市。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测3：</strong>比特币将在2021年再次创下历史新高。我个人认为，在这个牛市周期中，比特币价格可能达到5 -10万美元。我相信这可能会在2021年实现。2021年全年，货币政策将继续印钞，用以刺激全球经济。而比特币供应量的增幅已降至每区块6.25 BTC，或者说其每年的供应通胀仅为1.7%。这是世界上表现最好的资产，并将继续跑赢大盘。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>比特币在2021年11月突破68000美元关口，创下历史新高。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测4：</strong>我们将看到至少一种无需信任的稳定币的崛起。我指的是加密货币支持的稳定币或算法稳定币。我敢打赌，到2021年，其中一家公司的市值将超过5亿美元。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>2021年对稳定币来说是重要的一年。TerraUSD的市值为100亿美元，MIM为45亿美元，Frax为19亿美元，LiquityUSD为8.33亿美元，FeiUSD为7.62亿美元。在Apollo，我们继续看涨稳定币。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测5：</strong>Cardano将跌出Coingecko上十大加密货币资产的行列。尽管Cardano远胜于许多其他资产，但这所谓的前十排行榜依然不成熟，并将随着时间的推移而发生巨大变化。至于Layer 1智能合约平台，其竞争正变得愈加激烈。若Cardano仍能保持当前的排名，我会感到很惊讶。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>Cardano并未跌出前十名，目前排名第七。根据DeFiLlama Cardano的数据，在所有区块链中，Cardano拥有最高的市值/TVL 比例。但我认为，其市值下跌的速度会比获取TVL的速度更快。</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common question we are asked by our investors is, ‘How do you value crypto assets?’. There are many answers to this as the process of evaluating a crypto asset’s value can vary depending on its sector in the crypto asset industry, fundamentals, and functionality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto asset investors can analyse crypto assets via metrics common to the crypto asset industry and traditional finance. For example, crypto assets that fall into the DeFi category are often assessed with crypto-centric metrics such as Total Value Locked (TVL), fully diluted market capitalisation, circulating market capitalisation and traditional financial metrics such as the price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This blog post will clearly define these metrics and how we at Apollo Capital use them to supplement our analysis. It is important to note, these metrics should not be used as the sole basis for an investment decision, but form part of a framework in conjunction with other fundamental analysis.</span></p>
<p><strong>Crypto Metrics<br />
</strong></p>
<p>To understand size and rankings of DeFi crypto assets, investors can analyse the following statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Circulating market capitalisation: Total value of crypto assets in circulation
<ul>
<li>The circulating supply of tokens x Price per token</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fully diluted market capitalisation: Total value of crypto assets that will be existence
<ul>
<li>The maximum supply of tokens x Price per tokens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TVL: The sum of all assets deposited in decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols earning rewards, interest, new coins</li>
</ul>
<p>The higher these figures are relative to other crypto assets, the more mature and established the protocol. In addition, crypto assets with large, fully diluted market capitalisations relative to circulating supply indicate a significant amount of tokens will be released in the future which in turn could dilute the value of the asset.</p>
<p><strong>P/E Ratios<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The P/E is a popular metric as it gives investors insights into the value of the asset by portraying the expectations of the market and the price at which the investor must pay per unit of annual earnings.</p>
<p>With crypto assets the P/E formula most commonly used is:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1236 size-full" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-12-03_13-39-43.jpg" alt="" width="1552" height="358" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-12-03_13-39-43.jpg 1552w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-12-03_13-39-43-300x69.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-12-03_13-39-43-1024x236.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-12-03_13-39-43-768x177.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-12-03_13-39-43-1536x354.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1552px) 100vw, 1552px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total earnings in crypto assets refers to the annual revenue the protocol creates for the holders and can be done in different ways depending on the asset. For instance, the decentralised exchange tokens generate revenue to their users through liquidity provider fees, lending and borrowing protocols provide revenue in the form of total yield generated and layer one assets create revenue to participants (validators and miners) through transaction fees. Even though these participants are not necessarily holders of the layer one asset, this blog will still include P/E ratio analysis on these assets.</p>
<p><strong>Different P/E Ratio Investors<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Depending on an investor’s goals the P/E ratio figures can resonate differently. For value investors a low P/E ratio would be favoured as it implies the market is valuing the asset lower than its intrinsic value. Growth investors are more enticed to buy assets with a higher P/E ratio based on the thought that the higher rate of earnings growth and absolute value of the earnings validates the high P/E ratio.</p>
<p>Crypto investors like traditional equity investors will not base an investment decision on a low or high P/E Ratio. Instead, they will use it as one source of information among many within an investment decision-making matrix.</p>
<p><strong>Layer One Crypto Assets</strong></p>
<p>Layer one crypto asset’s protocol revenue annualized is calculated by the total revenue the protocol generates in transaction fees from users of the blockchain.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1228 size-full" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/L1-PE.jpg" alt="" width="1004" height="278" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/L1-PE.jpg 1004w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/L1-PE-300x83.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/L1-PE-768x213.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1004px) 100vw, 1004px" /></p>
<p>Layer one blockchain assets are the least suitable to analyse using P/E ratios from all the examples provided in this blog. This is due to the fact that the protocol revenue is not attributable to the asset holders. However, this protocol revenue along with the crypto metrics can give investors a gauge on the overall maturity of the layer one asset.</p>
<p>Reviewing the table, Ethereum clearly distinguishes itself as the value asset with the highest crypto metrics and lowest P/E ratio. On the other hand, Avalanche and Fantom, with high P/E ratios, appear overvalued, whilst the remainders could be seen as highly overvalued or speculative.</p>
<p><strong>Decentralised Exchanges and Trading Platforms</strong></p>
<p>Decentralised Exchanges (DEX) and trading platform assets generate their revenue from the fees associated with using the protocol. These would typically be distributed to the liquidity providers, providing the assets to the AMMs to allow for permissionless trading. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1229 size-full" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PE-DEX.jpg" alt="" width="1001" height="449" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PE-DEX.jpg 1001w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PE-DEX-300x135.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PE-DEX-768x344.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" /></p>
<p>These assets are most receptive to P/E ratio analysis. PancakeSwap, the number one DEX on Binance Smart Chain, is one of the oldest protocols in the table above. It also has the second highest total value locked. Similarly to Ethereum in the previous example, it could be categorised as a well-established value asset.</p>
<p>GMX is on the other end of the table as one of the youngest protocols, with a P/E ratio of 31.94. GMX is a speculative derivatives trading platform with solid price performance since its inception in September 2021. The high P/E ratio in this instance could be justified and attractive to an investor seeking growth assets.</p>
<p>SushiSwap and Trader Joe are two protocols to review closely in this table. Both have high P/E ratios and the second and third largest circulating market capitalisations. As a result, investors could view the price relative to PankcakeSwap as being overpriced.</p>
<p>Curve Finance has maintained an extremely high valuation despite weak earnings from trading fees distributed to the CRV holders. Curve Finance is a market leader in decentralised stablecoin swapping. However, with a P/E of 224.48, a 10x multiple higher than the other large DEXs, the market’s expectations might be too large.</p>
<p>Compared to the layer one blockchain assets, the P/E ratio can provide more relevant insights when used on DEX and trading platform assets.</p>
<p><strong>Decentralised Borrowing and Lending Protocols</strong></p>
<p>The P/E Ratio can be particularly relevant for decentralised money market assets. This segment displays a wide P/E ratio range of 9 to 241, with the mean P/E for these protocols being higher than the exchange and trading platform protocols. As a result, this table can reveal some crypto assets that the market is potentially unnoticing and overvaluing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1230 size-full" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LB.jpg" alt="" width="1007" height="413" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LB.jpg 1007w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LB-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LB-768x315.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1007px) 100vw, 1007px" /></p>
<p>The first crypto asset that stands out in this table is yearn.finance. Like the previous two tables displayed, the asset with the lowest P/E in its class has been a market leader and a value asset. Yearn.finance, considered a blue-chip DeFi, is an asset that generates revenue through total yield generated as an aggregator for liquidity pools. It’s circulating market capitalisation is average sized and it is the only asset with a P/E ratio in the single digits, indicating much stronger earnings relative to price than its counterparts. Purely from this table and the P/E ratio, a value investor would suggest this asset is undervalued.</p>
<p>Using the basic crypto metrics, Compound and Aave are market leaders in the decentralised borrowing and lending sector, with top three ranked TVL and circulating market capitalisation figures. Being market leaders, an analyst may deduce a P/E ratio of approximately 60 could be a standard benchmark in this DeFi category.</p>
<p>Maple Finance, Lido Finance and Ribbon Finance are all relatively new DeFi protocols that have a higher P/E Ratio probably due to market expectations of strong growth.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>Looking at crypto assets through the lens of the P/E Ratio means evaluating them based on their protocol revenue relative to their size, and basic crypto metrics help establish comparisons for investors to rank assets based upon circulating market capitalisation and TVL. In addition, most of the crypto assets provided in this blog can generate earnings for crypto asset holders, similarly to investors investing in specific stocks. In unison with several other fundamental analysis tools, these shared properties lend the P/E Ratio as a suitable tool for valuing certain DeFi crypto assets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Crypto-Powered Future is Already Here</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing is essentially an attempt to predict the future by allocating capital to the most promising companies, technologies, or economic models, adjusted for risk tolerance. In December 2003, William Gibson, one of the most influential Cyberpunk authors, wrote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;The future is already here – it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that some people are already doing and experiencing the futuristic things that the larger population will see as commonplace in the near future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crypto-powered, decentralized, and blockchain-enabled future world is already here; it just hasn’t reached everyone yet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Crypto is eating the world, and it’s happening faster than you think</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years ago in August 2011, Internet pioneer and visionary venture capitalist, Marc Andreesen, published a blog in the Wall Street Journal called, </span><a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Software Is Eating the World</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In it, he described how Software and Web companies were disrupting and supplanting many real-world industries and legacy business models, and at the same time dispelled arguments that this was a dangerous bubble similar to the Dot Com era of the late 1990’s. He should know. Marc was a founder of Netscape, which developed the world’s first user-friendly Web browser, and whose IPO in 1995 sparked that boom and launched the beginning of the Internet Age. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eventual ubiquity and inevitably of Software and the Web looks blindingly obvious with the benefit of hindsight, but it was not well understood nor distributed at the time. The same arguments are now being made against Crypto; that it’s an unsustainable and speculative bubble, a niche technology used by a minority of people, and a fad that will be regulated out of existence if it becomes too successful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto combines software with cryptography and decentralized blockchain technology, and is powered by network effects, viral propagation, consensus governance mechanisms, and transparent financial and behavioral incentives. Many industry participants including Alex Mashinsky and Raoul Paul have already observed that ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now eating the world’, disrupting traditional financial markets and even some of the same software business models that Marc wrote about. Unsurprisingly, Andreesen Horowitz was an early </span><a href="https://a16z.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters-nyt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocate of Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2014, and recently raised a second $2.2 billion venture capital fund to invest in this emerging asset class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Apollo Capital, it is our belief that we have already entered a new era (perhaps ‘the Crypto Age’) where large parts of our daily lives – work, social networks, financial capital, human interaction, entertainment, gaming, music, and artistic creativity – will be digitized and increasingly tokenized to be stored and exchanged on a blockchain. These will be overlapping and interacting networks of value that will benefit from Metcalfe’s Law of exponential growth. Few understand that we are in the midst of a revolution in money, finance, and culture that is in the early days of adoption and price discovery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Traditional Finance is the Main Course</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto has found a major product-market fit in the area of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). DeFi is an emerging ecosystem of financial applications and interoperable protocols built on blockchain technology that has begun eating away at the multi-hundred trillion dollar capital markets including borrowing and lending, market-making, store of value, fixed income, derivatives, foreign exchange, payments, remittances, mortgages, asset management, and interest rate swaps, among others – all without a real world financial intermediary. Instead, ‘smart contracts’, written in software code, control the execution of every transaction, removing counterparty risk and the need for a centralized authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a Cambrian explosion of new DeFi projects, and enormous amounts of capital are already flowing into DeFi as the Total Value Locked (TVL) has reached $195 billion, an 830% increase so far this year. Much of the activity is taking place on the Ethereum network, which settles $500 billion of transactions each month and is on pace to settle $8 trillion in 2021, the most in Crypto. ETH, the native token of Ethereum, which generates more than $20 million in daily fees for network miners, is predicted to become a deflationary asset (the total supply decreases over time) starting in 2022 with its migration to a ‘proof of stake’ consensus model. ETH is being described as ‘ultra-sound money’; a potentially superior store of value and a medium of exchange for a wide range of Internet transactions. Compared to Bitcoin’s singular value proposition of an immutable digital store of value, Ethereum, as the original smart contract platform, has many more use cases in DeFi. The Lightning Network is a “Layer 2” scaling protocol that has been in development for years and will enable faster transactions and payments on the Bitcoin network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The innovative economic structures of the future will not be traditional corporations, but rather </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/2021/07/the-era-of-the-dao/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DAOs), operated by volunteer communities of software and capital contributors with democratic and transparent governance policies enacted by proposal voting according to the ownership of protocol tokens. For Crypto projects, DAOs will replace highly regulated legal and hierarchical structures that are controlled by Board of Directors, full-time management teams, and equity shareholders. Driven by open source software, Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), rather than centralized Stock Exchanges, facilitate roughly $60 billion per month of permissionless peer-to-peer trading, creating high liquidity for the vast majority of tokens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another relatively recent innovation, US-dollar pegged stablecoins, have a current market value of $130 billion and enable near instant transfer of value anywhere in the world. Anyone who has tried to wire money overseas (even to an account they own) knows the pain, delay, and limitations of the byzantine and antiquated banking system. In free markets, improved user experience and reduced cost will always prevail over incumbent solutions. The commercialization of the Web has proven this beyond any doubt. Traditional Banks will either soon experience NGMI (“Not Gonna Make It”), or if they want to retain customer deposits, plug directly into DeFi platforms to offer innovative payment and yield products. The leading centralized Crypto exchange, Coinbase, has announced it will allow customers to deposit paychecks directly to their accounts. Shots fired!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>The Web, Culture, and Gaming will be Dessert</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto will infiltrate and permeate just about everything that’s accessible online, and onboard a large new audience to the Crypto asset ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook, with 2.9 billion global users, recently announced it is betting the company’s future on transitioning into a Metaverse company, and is pursuing plans to launch a Crypto stablecoin called Diem. PayPal has integrated Crypto into its global person-to-person and e-commerce payment network. Visa, Mastercard, and Verifone are doing likewise. Reddit, the Web’s largest discussion board platform, launched an Ethereum-based rewards program for community members. Amazon has been rumored to be researching a token strategy. Companies like Microsoft, KFC, The Dallas Mavericks, Norwegian Air, and countless online stores already accept payment in Crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the first Non-Fungible Token was minted on a blockchain in 2014, NFTs (often priced in ETH) really hit the popular zeitgeist in late 2020 with major drops by artists like Beeple and Trevor Jones setting sales records that rivaled the Masters of the traditional fine art world. EtherRocks, Bored Apes, and Crypto Punks are the new ultimate status symbol assets (or “flex”) with collectors now using these unique digital NFTs as online identity avatars. Twitter will soon allow its 350 million users to authenticate their ownership of NFTs on the platform. Jack Dorsey has integrated Bitcoin into both Square, for investment and trading, and Twitter, for tipping and payments. Multi-chain wallets for storing and transacting in Crypto are already integrated into Web browsers and likely soon into Apple Wallet and Google Pay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online gaming is adopting in-game NFTs and has created a ‘Play-To-Earn’ (P2E) business model where players receive tokens and unique items as rewards, based on their skill and achievements. The leading P2E game, Axie Infinity, is on track to generate $1.4 billion in 2021 revenue and has 350,000 daily players, mostly in the Philippines, who are often earning enough to make a living and support their families. Axie’s $35 billion market cap places it in the top five most valuable gaming companies in the world. Using NFTs, cross-game marketplaces, and the blockchain to verify and transport their avatars and items, Crypto game players will interact in an interoperable virtual universe (aka “The Metaverse”). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fashion and music industries will also incorporate NFTs. Dolce &amp; Gabbana recently sold their first NFT collection for $5.65 million. Songs will soon be tokenized so that fans can participate in their ownership and earn royalties from their favorite artists, establishing music as a new form of investment. NFTs will exist at the intersection of culture and finance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking this trend to its logical and fullest expression, we expect the major Social Networks, gaming companies, music streamers, and Web services will integrate Crypto and decentralize their platforms to some degree. The massive global outage of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp is a glaring example of why a decentralized Web is the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Dinero Mágico de Internet</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very few people (other than Jack Mallers from Strike) expected a country to adopt Crypto in 2021, and yet El Salvador, which translates to “The Savior”, made Bitcoin legal tender alongside the almighty US dollar in June. According to President Nayib Bukele</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 million people or nearly half of the 6.4 million Salvadorans are already actively using the state-backed Chivo Bitcoin wallet. That is more accounts than any single bank in the country and likely on track to exceed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banks in the country. Talk about banking the unbanked!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its historical volatility, Bitcoin is the best performing asset of any kind over the last 10 years. Much concern has been expressed over Bitcoin’s power usage and carbon footprint, and perhaps this is warranted, but Bitcoin will have positive benefits as it monetizes the stranded power from legacy utilities and remote renewable sources. Electric utilities in the US are turning to Bitcoin mining to capture off-peak power and for load balancing. Ukraine has formally legalized Crypto and is exploring Bitcoin mining using nuclear power. Laos and Paraguay are legalizing Bitcoin trading and have announced plans to utilize excess hydro-generated power for mining. El Salvador’s state-owned power company will provide mining facilities with cheap, clean geothermal energy, harnessed from the country&#8217;s volcanoes. Understandably, very few people want to live anywhere near a volcano and the lack of a robust electricity grid can make transmitting power to urban centers uneconomical. Bitcoin fixes this. The limitless geothermal energy can be transformed into digital value and transmitted cheaply. Think of this as a store of abundant energy in a digital battery, or even digital gold that can be dug up and transmitted at the speed of light. In doing so, Bitcoin may ultimately hasten the adoption of renewable energy worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare this forward thinking to the United States where the SEC is still dragging its heels on approving any of the 18 Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications on file. It’s only a matter of time, though, and this will be a major step forward to widespread adoption of Crypto, triggering a huge inflow of new capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong><i>Software Disruption Meets the Velocity of Capital</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Crypto, the disruptive forces of software (digital distribution, iterative improvements, and decentralized contribution) combine with the velocity of capital (highly fluid liquidity that seeks yield, removes inefficiencies and intermediaries) to create a powerful, global, and permissionless 24/7 digital free market whose goal is adoption, efficiency, and exchange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are two relentless and insatiable forces that will drive widespread adoption and propagate Crypto through their inherent positive feedback loops across concentric networks of value. Money is becoming programmable, and the definition of and types of money will evolve and their uses will mushroom. Crypto is truly “the future of finance”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto has the incredible advantage of leveraging decades of global Internet and mobile infrastructure investment and adoption that will facilitate its exponential growth. Roughly 48% of the world&#8217;s population, or 3.8 billion people, own a smartphone and can access decentralized browser-based Crypto and DeFi platforms, democratizing financial inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin, and the entire Crypto movement, was born out of the Global Financial Crisis in 2009, and the ongoing debasement of Fiat currencies, negative real yields, and the growing distrust of government and financial institutions have proven powerful accelerants. The “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/O1hCLBTD5RM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money Printer go Brrr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” meme has done more to explain the current Central Bank monetary policy than any Economics textbook. Innovative companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Galaxy Digital have adopted Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset to help solve the ‘</span><a href="https://youtu.be/WrR95PFYDFQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">melting ice cube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ problem of Fiat currency, as Michael Saylor calls it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With BTC at $47,000 and ETH at $3,300, the entire Crypto market is valued at roughly $2.1 trillion, which would rank it between the market caps of Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft. For reference, the global stock markets are valued at $95 trillion, gold at $11 trillion, the broad M2 money supply is another $100 trillion, and outstanding bonds are valued at $130 trillion. With the current trajectory and inertia, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine Crypto’s market cap increasing 3-10x over the next decade. Bullish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>The Final Boss</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the major risks to Crypto&#8217;s success – technology, value proposition, economic model, product-market fit, and consumer and institutional adoption – are well on the way to being solved. What’s left to overcome? Nation State attacks and unreasonable financial regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve already seen a concerted, multi-year attack by China with its “banning of Crypto” (annually since 2013!) and it’s recent total ban on Bitcoin mining, which caused a mass exodus of miners, a broad market panic sell-off, and a significant impact to the network hash rate (a measure of the processing power that secures the Bitcoin network). Impressively, this forced a dramatic decentralization of the network, which is now reassembling itself in more favorable jurisdictions like the US, Canada, Russia, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and Kazakhstan with the </span><a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hash rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already back to mid-May 2021 levels. This is a long-term positive, removes a key vulnerability, and has proven the Bitcoin network’s resilience and antifragility. Is the Law of Unintended Consequences a thing in China?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems the Final Boss for Crypto to defeat is the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission and what form the now certain regulation will take. Our expectation is that regulation will be a long-term positive as the framework will provide legal, tax, and regulatory certainty, and more formally integrate Crypto into the global economy, allowing broad participation from investment funds, retirement accounts, corporate treasuries, and sovereign wealth funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Apollo Capital, we expect significant ongoing market volatility in the short-term, but we are exceptionally confident in the long-term fundamental thesis that Crypto will power the new decentralized financial infrastructure of Web 3.0. The profound and disruptive innovation will continue despite token price fluctuations, and provide an asymmetric return opportunity for investors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Number Go Up</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To adapt a phrase about Software disruption from Marc Andreesen in 2011, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next 10 years, the battles between incumbents and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-powered insurgents will be epic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. However, Crypto will be different; globally inclusive, open source, censorship resistant, spearheaded by decentralized volunteer communities applying their own capital and ingenuity, fueled by memes and a desire to effect real change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward ten years from now, Crypto’s rise will look obvious and inevitable&#8230; just as the dominance of Software and the Web do today.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enormous credit and gratitude to Marc Andreesen, Mike Novogratz, Jack Mallers, Jack Dorsey, Michael Saylor, Elon Musk, President Nayib Bukele, Satoshi Nakamoto, and Vitalik Buterin for their leadership and inspiration. </span></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apollo Capital has always sought to provide transparent, clear information about the wonderful world of crypto assets.</p>
<p>In this 24 page report, we analyse Pendle Finance and the respective sectors of DeFi the project sits under; Yield Tokenisation and Fixed Rates.</p>
<p>Pendle Finance leverages the composable nature of DeFi to allow users to trade and receive fixed rates of interest on lending protocols and in liquidity pools. Pendle Finance’s design improvements from older fixed-rate protocols solve the major problems stifling these protocols from significant adoption.</p>
<p>While Pendle Finance is not without competition in the Yield Tokenisation sector, Pendle’s design choices make the protocol more useful and composable than competitors such as Element Finance. There are many ways in which users can interact with Pendle Finance to trade fixed rates and earn high yield through market neutral yield farming strategies.</p>
<p>We would like to thank TN Lee from the Pendle Finance team for the help and feedback received throughout this report.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy our first Research Report. Please feel free to share it to others you think might be interested and we look forward to bringing you more Research Reports in future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few months the crypto asset market has witnessed considerable Total Value Locked (TVL) growth across multiple blockchains. While Ethereum is still the leading DeFi ecosystem by a considerable margin, Layer 1 blockchains such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Solana and Terra have been gaining market share. Smaller investors are continually opting out of Ethereum in search for cheaper and faster transactions on these competing platforms. Large-scale protocol wide incentive programs are also driving growth with several protocols allocating considerable portions of their treasuries to liquidity mining on their native DeFi projects. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-779" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TVL-Assets-600x337.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Total Value Locked in DeFi </strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-785" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Total-TVL-600x221.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="221" /></p>
<h5></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the Ethereum blockchain being unusable for small investors, TVL has continued to grow at a high rate. The quality of projects on Ethereum continue to be the highest in the industry, and considerable capital in the form of ETH is constantly looking for new protocols. Because of this, building on Ethereum is still attractive for leading developers. Developments in layer 2 scaling technologies such as Arbitrum and Optimism are fuelling excitement from the community, although TVL growth on these solutions is yet to boom.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Total Value Locked in Ethereum </strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-780" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ETH-600x216.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="216" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Binance Smart Chain was the first competitor to Ethereum to witness explosive TVL growth. This growth was catalysed by an extremely smooth user onboarding experience as well as the general shift away from Ethereum layer 1 due to transaction fees. The quality of projects on this chain remains very low with scams, hacks and exploits being commonplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2021, Polygon was the first blockchain to launch a protocol layer incentive scheme. This scheme involved US$40 million of MATIC rewards being allocated to DeFi projects in an attempt to bring reputable Ethereum projects to the Polygon blockchain. This scheme was incredibly successful and resulted in explosive TVL and MATIC price growth. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Total Value Locked in Polygon</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-781" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Polygon--600x217.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="217" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana and Terra are the most differentiated blockchains out of these top DeFi ecosystems as they are not </span><a href="https://medium.com/@eiki1212/what-is-evm-ethereum-virtual-machine-f38310130114"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EVM compatible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning it is harder for native Ethereum users to migrate liquidity onto the chain. Despite this, investors have been consistently adopting these chains over the course of 2021 and DeFi activity is thriving. Solana and Terra have not launched protocol wide incentive programs and are witnessing more organic TVL growth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Total Value Locked in Solana</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-782" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Solana-600x218.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="218" /></p>
<p>Due to a robust blockchain and a well timed liquidity mining incentive regime, the layer one blockchain Fantom (FTM) has seen solid growth in price and TVL over the past month, with its price appreciating 410% and current TVL standing at $1.29B . Their incentives are different from the common incentive scheme. Instead of rewarding users for using protocols, they are rewarding the builders of the protocols, to sustain and grow their TVL on their respective protocols. Once rewarded, how the builders want to use them is up to their discretion. For example, they could run liquidity mining programs to entice more users and adoption on their platform, or run ‘bug bounty’ programs to have their code reviewed and sharpened.</p>
<p>Rewarding builders creating products with strong market fit will ensure that the stickiness for those platforms will stay high, which is contrary to the typical outcome of a liquidity mining reward incentive schemes, that see users logically jump to the most enticing incentivised programs. By incentivising protocols, teams can come up with creative ideas for user retention and the better they perform, the higher the rewards. The Apollo Capital Opportunities Fund is currently enjoying the rewards being offered on Fantom via the Curve protocol.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Total Value Locked in Fantom</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-783" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fantom-600x220.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="220" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avalanche is another blockchain that has announced a liquidity mining program recently, coined the </span><a href="https://medium.com/avalancheavax/avalanche-foundation-announces-180m-defi-incentive-program-d320fdfafff7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Avalanche Rush&#8217;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Avalanche Foundation has pledged $180M in crypto assets to be distributed to users interacting with DeFi on the Avalanche Ecosystem. These funds are being accessed via the Avalanche Foundation’s treasury. The goal of the program is to ‘showcase the power of Avalanche and allow users to dive into a vibrant community at the cutting edge of decentralised finance’ said by Gün Sirer, Director at the Avalanche Foundation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Total Value Locked in Avalanche</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-784" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AVAX-600x222.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="222" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent strength in Layer 1 blockchain assets has been fuelled by healthy Total Value Locked growth and fundamental value appreciation. The continued roll out of these protocol wide incentive schemes will drive higher yields and make DeFi even more attractive for new and old crypto investors. The competitive landscape that Ethereum finds itself in today is increasing the pressure on the blockchain to scale. The Eth2.0 developments over the next 6-12 months will be critical for the medium to long term success of the current number 2 crypto asset. </span></p>
