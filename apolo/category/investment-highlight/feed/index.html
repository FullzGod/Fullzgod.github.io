										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket Network is quickly establishing itself as a core part of Crypto and Web3 infrastructure. Before Pocket Network, the builders of decentralised applications (dApps) and wallet providers had no choice but to use centralised providers for critical infrastructure services. The infrastructure service that Pocket Network provides can simply be described as ‘fetching real-time data from a blockchain’. DApps, users, and wallet providers can now opt out of using a centralised provider like Infura for this real-time data and instead use Pocket Network’s decentralised network of node operators. The benefits of this decentralised alternative will be explained throughout this post. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Centralisation Problem</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As active investors in crypto assets, we are constantly looking for decentralised solutions to the problems that centralisation can cause. The current sector, Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), has been dominated by a centralised entity called Infura for the past five years and is ripe for disruption. Infura, a subsidiary of the blockchain technology solutions conglomerate ConsenSys, provides developers with the tools and infrastructure to alleviate the burden of running their own ‘data feeding’ tools so that they can instead focus on building their applications. The most popular crypto asset wallet, Metamask, is another product in ConsenSys’ product suite. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Infura has played a vital role in enabling the development and function of DAaps on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms, it has encountered several issues over the past 24 months. These issues include several outages due to the increasing demand for bandwidth across blockchain ecosystems, and their involvement in censoring certain users from accessing their Metamask wallets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2020, Infura lagged behind the rest of the Ethereum node network by not updating to the latest node client and subsequently suffered a significant outage. This shouldn’t have even come close to impacting the wider network; however, because of Infra’s scale and importance, the event </span><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/84232/ethereum-infrastructure-provider-infura-is-down"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caused the Ethereum blockchain to fork</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a result, forked exchanges halted deposits/withdrawals, and the popular wallet, MetaMask, could not be used. While the issue was resolved without any lasting problems, it highlighted some of the issues surrounding Ethereum’s overdependence on large centralised infrastructure services providers such as Infura. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infura and Metamask also came under fire in March of this year when they accidentally blocked Venezuelan users from accessing their digital wallets. The outage of these wallets occurred when Infura changed specific settings too broadly by applying certain geoblocks after the US had announced new sanctions due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The Venezuelan geoblocks were accidentally included in these setting updates leaving many Venezuelan users locked out of their digital wallets. Events like these draw attention to the flaws of a centralised service provider and the tremendous power that Infura possesses in the IaaS market. We believe dAaps and their smart contract builders will elect to utilise products that can offer 100% uptime and censorship-resistant solutions within the IaaS space. These are two features that are core to Pocket Network’s value proposition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Pocket Network Explainer</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket Network is a blockchain data ecosystem for Web3 applications. It is a platform built for applications that use cost effective economies to coordinate and distribute data at scale. Today, the Pocket Network distributes data feeds to numerous dApps across 40 networks, including Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Algorand, and Harmony. These data feeds are vital to the functionality of the dApps. They include any relevant information on a blockchain a certain dApp may require. For example, MyCrypto, a crypto asset wallet provider, will use Pocket Network to retrieve token prices, ticker symbols, contract addresses, gas prices, and other data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket Network’s tokenomics and consensus mechanisms are based on a Proof-of-Stake model, ensuring the data it relays is decentralised, and node operators are sufficiently incentivised. Today it has approximately 40,000+ nodes, which compute an average of 3 billion weekly relays to dApps across 40 networks seamlessly and securely. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Apollo Investment</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the fork caused by Infura in November 2020, we first spoke with Pocket Network Co-Founder and CEO, Michael O’Rourke, in January 2021. At that time, the network had averaged 23.25 million relays each week for the previous month and there were less than 1000 nodes on the network. In contrast, Infura was processing around 2 billion relays/API calls per day. Pocket Network had been quietly in development for over three years before we first spoke to the team. On the surface, it was hard to see the progress made over these 3 years due to the relatively low relays/API calls. However, after digging deeper, it was clear to us that Pocket Network had the potential to really shake up the sector. In February 2021, we proceeded to buy POKT tokens directly from the Pocket Network team for US$0.12 each, subject to a 12-month lock-up. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1407 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-1024x683.png" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-300x200.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-768x512.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-600x400.png 600w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following our investment, Pocket Network continued to be relatively underutilised and not very well known for a number of months. However, the network started to see increased traction and utilisation in Q4 2021 as the team added support for alternative Layer 1 chains such as Solana, Avalanche, Algorand and </span><a href="https://docs.pokt.network/home/resources/references/supported-blockchains"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the four weeks from 22-2-2022 to 24-3-2022, the Pocket Network averaged 1.738 billion relays per week with 37,820 nodes participating in the network. This represents a 74.75 times increase in weekly relays from 14 months earlier.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the middle of January 2022, the POKT token began trading on popular centralised exchanges; naturally this added to the excitement and hype surrounding the protocol. While the price chart below may not look favourable, the current valuation of POKT is an impressive US$918 million and significantly higher than our US$0.12 entry price. After seeing the network gain a level of traction, we directly purchased an additional tranche of POKT in December 2021 and began setting up staked nodes to increase our support for the network. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1409 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-1024x862.png" alt="" width="750" height="631" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-1024x862.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-300x253.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-768x647.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1.png 1179w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Apollo Node Operations </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operating a Pocket Network node requires a certain amount of POKT to be staked and a reasonable level of maintenance even with automation. In return for operating these nodes, we are rewarded with additional POKT in the form of both inflationary rewards and rewards driven by underlying network activity. Inflationary rewards refers to newly minted POKT; this increases the circulating supply of POKT and can have a negative impact on price if demand remains equal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our nodes currently represent 0.41% of the total network, this strategy is estimated to be generating a variable yield of around 100% APR on our total POKT staked. Apart from the minimum capital requirements, the main barrier to entry for running a node is the actual setting up of the nodes. We have leaned on the expertise of our in-house developer to activate and maintain these nodes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apollo Capital is proud to be supporting the Pocket Network as early investors and node runners. We are strong believers in the power of decentralisation and view Pocket Network as the key piece of the Web3 infrastructure required for blockchains to take another step towards complete decentralisation.   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is our third in-depth Research Report by Apollo Capital on the native cross-chain swapping protocol Chainflip. A project the Apollo Capital Fund invested in during an early round.</p>
<p>Apollo Capital has always acknowledged the future of the crypto asset industry will be one of the multiple blockchains, and interoperability among protocols will be an expectation. Currently, no applications can bridge or swap native assets cross-chain in a secure and trustless manner. Chainflip solves this as a decentralised, trustless protocol that enables cross-chain swaps between different blockchains.</p>
<p>In this 15 page report, we analyse the necessity for interoperability in the crypto asset market, the mechanics behind Chainflip, and the competitive landscape of interoperable protocols.</p>
<p>We want to thank Simon Harman from the Chainflip team for the help and feedback received throughout this report.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this Research Report. Please feel free to forward it to others you think might be interested, and we look forward to bringing you more Research Reports in future.</p>

<p class="">A key talking point in the Ethereum ecosystem is the concept and problem of miner extractable value (MEV). MEV is a relatively new and understudied phenomenon where miners and arbitrage bots can manipulate transaction data for economic gain at the expense of users.</p>
<p class="">In February 2021, Apollo Capital spoke to the team from <a href="https://www.ata.network/"><strong>Automata</strong></a>, a leading solution to MEV, and ultimately received an allocation in their private sale at a purchase price of US$0.02 per token. On June 7, Automata (ATA) launched through the Binance launchpad and hit a staggering all time high of US$1.97 within hours of trading. While <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/automata">ATA now trades at $0.54</a>, this investment highlights our ability to receive allocations into highly prized primary offerings and is a current return of 2,600%.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Miner (Maximum) Extractable Value</strong></p>
<p class="">There are two main forms of MEV. The first form of MEV is arbitrage bots frontrunning transactions that are submitted to decentralised exchanges (DEXs). These transactions are able to be front run by setting a higher gas price, enabling preferential ordering in a block. Arbitrage bots can carry out this process because transactions are publicly broadcasted to the Ethereum blockchain’s mempool before confirmation, the mempool is also known as ‘<a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest/">The Dark Forest</a>’ where savvy bots and miners prey on innocent DeFi users.</p>
<p class="">The next common form of MEV stems from the ability of block producers (miners in PoW systems and validators in PoS systems) to rewrite the order of transactions in a block as well as the ability to reorder blocks entirely, as is the case with the Ethereum blockchain. This form of MEV is particularly troubling as it means that particular malicious actors have an unfair advantage due to either being a block producer or paying a block producer to prioritise their transactions. It is not feasible for ecosystem participants to compete on a level playing field with these actors.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>History of MEV</strong></p>
<p class="">The concept of MEV was first formally introduced in April 2019 by Phil Daian and his Cornell colleagues in “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05234">Flash Boys 2.0</a>”. The research paper concludes with “They [MEV profits] constitute an economic vulnerability that should be a current cause for concern in Ethereum.” Following this initial conclusion, MEV continued to be a fringe topic of discussion in the Ethereum community as the negative effects of MEV remained relatively unnoticeable to everyday users. MEV was later popularised through the articles ‘<a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest/">The Dark Forest</a>’ &amp; ‘<a href="https://samczsun.com/escaping-the-dark-forest/">Escaping the Dark Forest</a>’ as well as the fact that frontrunners were adding to the high gas fee problem that Ethereum has suffered from.</p>
<p class="">Since the initial research paper published in April 2019, Phil Daian and the organisation ‘Flashbots’ have been leading the research and early solutions to MEV. <a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/overview">Flashbot Auctions</a> aims to make the MEV extraction process more fair and transparent by providing a private communication channel between Ethereum users and miners for efficiently communicating a preferred transaction order within a block. This communication channel is off-chain, which frees up block space and has proven to have a positive impact on gas fees as arbitrage bots are no longer competing on-chain.</p>

<p class=""><strong>The Cost of MEV</strong></p>
<p class="">The best resource to explore the cost of MEV is the <a href="https://explore.flashbots.net/">MEV-Explore v0 Dashboard</a> by Flashbots. This dashboard states that the Total Extracted MEV (since Jan 1, 2020) is US$750 million. We can see from the Cumulative Extracted MEV chart that MEV has been accelerating in recent months, which is particularly worrying for the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Ethereum 2.0 &amp; MEV</strong></p>
<p class="">The term ‘Miner Extractable Value’ can be misleading when predicting whether MEV will continue to be a problem once Ethereum moves to proof of stake. This explains why organisations such as flashbots are now referring to MEV as <strong>‘Maximum</strong> Extractable Value’. MEV will continue to be a problem on Ethereum 2.0 as the transaction ordering as we know it today will still exist on Eth 2.0. Early research also shows that Eth 2.0 MEV may actually cause greater problems because MEV on Eth 2.0 increases the variance of returns between the luckiest and unluckiest validators. This may cause additional pressure for oligopoly dynamics to form as validators will want to smooth out the variance of luck, this will potentially be prohibitive to solo validators.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Solutions &amp; Opportunities</strong></p>
<p class="">At Apollo Capital, we have been actively studying and following MEV for the past 8 months as discussion and debate have been increasing rapidly in the community. We are now seeing ‘first generation’ solutions to the problem come to market and witnessing early adoption. Examples include ArcherDAO’s <a href="https://github.com/archerdao/archerswap">Archerswap</a>, Chainlink’s <a href="https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-fair-sequencing-services-enabling-a-provably-fair-defi-ecosystem/">Fair Sequencing Services</a>, Gnosis’s <a href="https://cowswap.exchange/#/about">COWSwap</a>, Flashbot’s <a href="https://github.com/flashbots/pm">Flashbots Auction</a> and Automata’s <a href="https://medium.com/atanetwork/whats-automata-iv-conveyor-93c9335e4f43">Conveyor</a>. It is widely recognised that there is no ‘silver bullet’ solution to the MEV problem and that long term progress will come from technical breakthroughs and thoughtful dapp/DEX design.</p>

<p class=""><em>“Automata Network is a decentralised service protocol that provides middleware-like traceless privacy services for dApps on Ethereum and Polkadot to achieve privacy, high assurance and frictionless computation.” &#8211; Automata Network</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">These traceless privacy services include a MEV solution known as ‘Conveyor’ and an anonymous governance voting service known as ‘Witness’. Conveyor is a service that ingests and outputs transactions in a determined order, creating a front-running-free zone that removes the ability to reorder transactions. Automata is implementing ‘<a href="https://medium.com/atanetwork/introduction-to-sgx-why-oblivious-ram-5485a9010449">Oblivious RAM</a>’ (ORAM) in order to achieve this breakthrough, this is the first time that ORAM has been used in a blockchain protocol/project.</p>
<p class="">The team behind Automata have extensive blockchain expertise and experience with many team members being highly involved in Zilliqa (ZIL), a Layer 1 blockchain with a current fully diluted valuation of US$1.8 billion. Beyond Zilliqa, the team includes researchers from top universities who have published multiple papers on ORAM and blockchain technology in recent years.</p>
<p class="">For Automata’s MEV solution to be successful it will require adoption at the dApp level, rather than the user level. For example, major exchanges such as Uniswap or SushiSwap will need to integrate Conveyor into their product in order for users to get protection from front running rather than users choosing to get protection by using something like <a href="https://github.com/archerdao/archerswap">Archerwap</a> or <a href="https://cowswap.exchange/#/about">COWSwap</a>. Automata’s Conveyor is designed to be lightweight and easy to implement. We believe that as the ecosystem develops and the negative effects of MEV become continually apparent, developers will be motivated to explore MEV solutions such as Conveyor in an attempt to gain and retain ‘MEV conscious&#8217; users.</p>

<p class="">Nothing quite sums up the open, permissionless and fast paced nature of DeFi like <a href="https://yearn.finance/">Yearn Finance</a>.</p>
<p class="">In February 2020, Andre Cronje created Yearn Finance to automate the yield farming strategy that he was performing manually on behalf of his family and close friends. This trading strategy was simply moving his USD stablecoins between the various lending protocols in order to achieve the maximum yield possible.</p>
<p class="">In mid July 2020, Yearn Finance launched it’s governance token YFI in order to decentralise the project and attract capital through ‘yield farming’. The launch of this token increased the total value locked (TVL) in Yearn from US$7.8 million to $336 million in only 7 days. Apollo was an early farmer of YFI and almost half of our current YFI holdings were farmed throughout July and August.</p>

<p class="">Although Yearn Finance began as a lending aggregator it is now described as “a suite of products in Decentralised Finance, maintained by various independent developers and governed by YFI holders”. The most popular products on Yearn are the capital pools known as ‘Vaults’, these vaults are designed to automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market. These vaults automate complex yield farming strategies in order to generate the maximum amount of yield possible. Vaults are created and maintained by developers known as strategist’s, who are incentivised by receiving a share in the profits of the strategies they create.</p>
<p class="">YFI reached it’s all time high price of US$43,678 on the 12th of September 2020. With a total supply of only 30,000 YFI, this price put a $1.3 billion valuation on the 2 month old coin. YFI subsequently witnessed a brutal sell off and traded for around $8,500 for two days in November. Since then, Yearn Finance have announced multiple partnerships with similar DeFi projects which have been described as the first M&amp;A activity performed by a decentralised protocol. These partnerships are a core part of Yearn Finance’s imminent V2 release.</p>

<p class="">Key partnerships:</p>
<p class=""><a href="https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-cream-v2-merger-e9fa6c6989b4">Cream Finance</a>: Cream specialises in lending- related products and will allow Yearn to expand its various strategies through the use of leverage and the addition of an in-house money market.</p>
<p class=""><a href="https://medium.com/iearn/%CE%BC%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BD-%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1-yearn-x-akropolis-16f5351af35e">Akropolis</a>: Akropolis will become the front-of-house institutional service provider for Yearn Finance’s best-in-class Vault and Lending protocol solutions.</p>
<p class=""><a href="https://medium.com/iearn/pickle-yearn-ferment-co-operation-dill-eec43b93d0ea">Pickle Finance</a>: Pickle Finance specialises in yield generating Vaults (known as Pickle Jars) that are very similar to Yearn’s Vaults. Their partnership will reduce duplicated work, increase specialisation and leverage the shared expertise of both Pickle and Yearn developers. In essence, the purpose of this partnership is to acquire talented developers.</p>
<p class=""><a href="https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-cover-merger-651142828c45">Cover Protocol</a>: Cover is a decentralised insurance protocol that will become the backstop cover provider for the Yearn product suite. This partnership will allow for users to be protected against smart contract risk.</p>
<p class="">Beyond these partnerships, the founder of Yearn Finance has announced the launch of a new project called <a href="https://andrecronje.medium.com/deriswap-capital-efficient-swaps-futures-options-and-loans-ea424b24a41c">Deriswap</a>. Deriswap combines token Swaps, Options and Loans into a single capital efficient contract. It is currently unknown whether Deriswap will be integrated into Yearn or operate as a standalone product. However, Andre has acknowledged that his motivations for creating Deriswap options stem from wanting to incorporate options into Yearn Vault strategies to mitigate price risk.</p>
<p class="">Yearn Finance and the YFI token have had an extremely volatile past 5 months both in price action and investor sentiment. Despite this, the core developers behind the protocol didn’t stop building and continued to drive the project forward from a technical perspective. Following the recent announcements, imminent V2 launch and a shift in investor sentiment, YFI is currently trading at $26,000.</p>
<p class="">No other project quite exemplifies the permissionless nature of innovation in crypto, the free-flow of liquidity in DeFi and the free market like Yearn Finance and YFI. If you had to pick one project so sum up the crypto market in 2020, it would have to be Yearn Finance. YFI is cementing its place as a DeFi infrastructure play in Apollo’s portfolio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">The Open Financial System also called Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is a major focus for us at Apollo Capital and core to our <a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2019/6/4/investment-thesisnbsprefresh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investment Thesis</a>. DeFi is about building permissionless access to financial assets and financial contracts to anyone in world.</p>
<p class="">The <a href="https://www.synthetix.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Synthetix</a> platform is tackling the former. They are building a platform for any kind of assets to be accessible by anyone in the world with a smartphone and an Internet connection — that’s a big vision and Synthetix is currently building very fast towards to that goal.</p>
<p class="">In short, Synthetix is a middleware protocol on top of Ethereum with its own protocol asset called SNX. Holders of SNX can issue sUSD which is Synthetix’s USD stablecoin. On the Synthethix Exchange, users can get exposure to all kind of assets.</p>
<p class="">Below is a transcript from a conversation that I recently had with Kain Warwick, Founder of Synthetix. I thought it was an absolutely fascinating discussion about how they are looking to grow the ecosystem, their long term vision and how they aggressively is looking to decentralise Synthetix in the months ahead.</p>
<p class=""><strong><br />
Henrik</strong>: Today I’m talking with Kain Warwick from Synthetix. This is an absolutely fascinating DeFi protocol. I will preface this discussion by saying that Apollo at this moment holds SNX in our portfolio.</p>
<p>So Kain, do you want to give a quick introduction to yourself and your background.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Sure. So I’ve been in crypto for awhile. I run a payment gateway called Blueshyft, which is how we originally got to know each other. We process payments for a bunch of crypto exchanges domestically, and internationally for exchanges such as Binance. We have been running that business since 2014. As we got deeper into the crypto space through 2015–2016 when the business ramped up, we saw an opportunity in the stablecoin space and we launched a project called Havven which eventually evolved into Synthetix. So that’s how I got into the space originally.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: Fantastic. Defi is about building permissionless access to financial assets and contracts to anyone in world and your team is building a platform for really any kind of assets to be accessible by anyone in the world with a smartphone and an Internet connection.</p>
<p class="">As you mentioned you launched Havven last year and have since pivoted and rebranded to Synthetix which has gained some traction recently.</p>
<p>Would you like to describe how Synthetix assets are created in more detail?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Sure, so Synthetix assets are fairly complex products but actual usage is relatively straight forward. The idea is that you hold an asset that give you exposure to another asset. In our case you hold an asset on Ethereum that gives you exposure to an asset in the real world. Things like synthetic gold, synthetic silver, we got things like synthetic equities and indices coming up. So you can create complex products like indices for example. We have a synthetic index of all the exchange tokens and we actually have a DeFi token index coming up. So the idea is that someone who like exposure to an asset can hold exposure on the Ethereum network and get exposure to that price.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: Once sUSD is created you can trade that asset on the Synthetix Exchange for other assets using something you call infinite liquidity which is really cool. Can you describe how infinite liquidity works?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Within the network, once you’re on the synthetic asset platform that we operate, you have a right if you’re holding a synthetic asset, which is effectively debt. Someone has locked collateral and issued this debt and they price this debt in for example USD or gold. So if you come to acquire that debt by buying the asset on the market or potentially mint it yourself you have a right to turn up to the contract and say I have this debt priced in USD, I’ve got 5,000 USD worth of synthetic assets, and I’d like to reprice it into Bitcoin to track the price of Bitcoin. The contract will then essentially burn the debt priced in USD and create new debt priced in Bitcoin. So that debt will now move with the price in Bitcoin instead of the price in USD. And that right is not capped, so you can turn up with 5,000 USD, 500 USD or 5 million USD and the contract will allow you, at the price that the oracle is pushing to the contract, to convert x amount of USD to x amount of Bitcoin. So that allows you to have infinite liquidity just constrained by the amount of debt you’re holding.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: That’s great. So the SNX exchange is where these assets are minted essentially.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain:</strong> Correct yeah.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: What kind of assets do you have on the exchange today?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Today we have Synth fiat currencies, things like synthetic AUD, USD, GBP etc. and then we have some commodities like gold and silver and then we have a number of synthetic crypto assets. On the Ethereum network you can’t obviously easily get exposure to Bitcoin, there are a few options out there but Bitcoin is an asset that a lot of people wold like exposure to, so the ability to have exposure and trade bitcoin against other assets on Ethereum is quite powerful. And then we got a number of other synthetic assets like synthetic BNB, and as I mentioned an index of exchange tokens. And that’s a quite a cool product because to hold a basket of exchange tokens, is not easy. Most exchange tokens don’t trade on every exchange, some are on different blockchains, some are on Ethereum some are on their own chains, and so it can be quite difficult to have a basket of them. And to be able to just click one button to have an exposure to all to them, be it long or short is quite powerful.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: So that’s quite a lot of assets you have today. What’s the next step here? I believe you’ve been taking about other leverage assets and then perhaps real world assets like stocks as well?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Correct, the idea of having exposure to real world assets on Ethereum is quite powerful. Maybe less so for people in places like the US and Australia that have access to brokerage accounts, but if you go to places like Thailand or Vietnam it might be difficult to have exposure to Uber or Amazon or Apple etc. But there are a number of things that needs to be solved before we’re able to roll out assets like that. Price feeds are critical, ensuring that we got the right kind of structure from a regulatory perspective — there are a whole bunch of things that needs to happen. So it’s probably not going to happen until next year.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: Thats amazing. Do you see these assets mainly being traded on the Synthetix Exchange or outside the exchange? Or shall we see SNX exchange more of a place where these assets are minted as I mentioned before?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: They are ERC-20 tokens so they can be traded anywhere. But I think the interesting thing is that for most assets that we have the most liquidity will be on our own Synthetix Exchange. Reason being that you have this right to reprice the debt — you can turn up with 10,000 USD worth of say synthetic Bitcoin. In order to have that on an exchange you’d need a lot trading activity, a lot of volume. So what we have done is focused on a couple of assets to ensure that we got liquidity in and out of the exchange. We use Uniswap and Synthetic ETH which has a very deep pool, about 20,000 ETH on either side of the Uniswap pool which is something that most people who follow DeFi is familiar with. And then we also have some centralised exchanges that trade synthetic USD. We want people to be able to get in and out of synthetic assets from other Ethereum assets to move in and out using exchanges but most volume we expect over time to aggregative on the Synthetix Exchange.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: Makes sense. Stepping back a moment, it would be good to describe what is backing these assets, because they don’t have a real world backing they are all synthetic. I guess one way to view is that SNX stakers are on aggregate short synthetic assets and there is some risk there if those assets perform very well you debt will increase in value. So what happens if the SNX ratio to Synthetix assets go down? How do you see that playing out?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Yeah so I think there are a number things to unpack with that, that relates to some of the risks in the system. I think what Synthetix is on a fundamental level is a way of coordinate people to have capital and for people to provide that service. The service that is being provided is this infinite liquidity, derivatives, an exchange where anyone can show up and trade — and there is a lot of demand for that. We obviously see on exchanges like Bitmex, Deribit etc that there are a ton of volume going through futures and derivatives exchanges. We have a strong belief that a system like that, that is created by pooled collateral from a bunch of different people who are providing that collateral, that is providing that capital to offer that service will have high demand. So you have created this contract that sits in the middle that is essentially providing this capital that services the function of a clearing house. Then the next question is how do you ensure that that clearing house stays market neutral? What do you do? The interesting thing is that if you look at traditional clearing houses, large banks etc, it is there job individually, the entity that is the bank or whatever, to hedge their risk. Sometimes they get it wrong, sometimes they get it right. There is a lot of people within those organisations but ultimately there is one entity that is responsible. The interesting thing with Synthetix is that there is actually no individual person’s responsibility — there is this market driven approach of everyone is responsible to hedging their own risk in their own way. What I think that creates is an environment where people are tempted to compete with each other to stay market neutral, to hedge outside the exchange. That’s a hedging process of people saying ‘I see there is a lot of long Bitcoin exposure within the Synthetix exchange let me go and hedge myself by going long in the spot market’. Some people might buy futures or options depending on what they have access to. When you look at things like equities it tend to be more interesting, take an index like S&amp;P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average, typically they go up over a long enough time horizon. If someone sits in that index, that will likely go up over time. So how do we hedge ourselves for that? The answer is that you go those markets, and if you have access which market makers, and traders do, you hedge yourself. What happens is that inside the Synthetix Exchange everyone is long these indices, equities and other assets, but externally they are hedged. So you capture the fees and the trading activity from the derivatives that are being traded but you don’t have exposure to the long bias. That level of maturity is where we will get to. On aggregate depending on the macro outlook there might be a long or short bias but people are responsible for how they want to hedge that externally. And every individual SNX holder have that responsibility. It is their choice, their strategy and their tactical approach to hedging themselves that will keep it market neutral. But there is also this approach of trying to keep the actual Synthetix Exchange assets as neutral as possible. When you look at futures markets, typically you have a mechanism where long pays shorts or vice versa depending of what open interest looks like. When we launch synthetic positions, we will have a mechanism where if all the open interest is long then we will have a higher margin cost to keep the position open and that will be paid to the shorts that will hopefully bring people who are looking to hedge long or short into the market and bring it back to a little more neutral and that will make it easier for the SNX holders to hedge externally. There are all these kind of different layers to ensure that the market remains neutral. But ultimately what you have at the end of the day ideally this system that people can turn up to trade, they don’t have to understand all the hedging and all the complexity in the background they can just know that they can come and trade.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: Right because the average users, they will buy these assets on Uniswap or on your exchange and they are not necessary involved in minting these assets.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Correct.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: And what’s the incentive for SNX holders to mint these assets. I believe you have two kind of rewards, you have SNX rewards and exchange fees right?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: And both rewards will be there for the foreseeable future?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Yeah so they will. Ideally as the system matures and system grows we would want the exchange fees to be the predominate reward for providing the service. Again, the idea is that anyone can join at any time and if people are trading and there is demand for these assets, fees will be generated and there will be demand to participate in the network. In the early days to bootstrap this before there is a lot of trading activity you need some kind of protocol level incentive for people to participate so that’s why we have the SNX staking rewards as well. That allows people to understand the system, to start staking to get the flywheel going if you will.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: And you will have a tail emission there as well so the SNX rewards will keep going?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: We don’t currently have a tail emission. It is one of the other interesting things about our project. We have a decentralised protocol for governance that happens through our community. It operates on a rough consensus basis. At the moment there is an open proposal by some of our community members to modify the inflation schedule and introduce tail emission. At the moment there isn’t one. In another roughly three years inflation is ended. So that’s a debate that is going in the community right now.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: Got you. And another thing that is going on right now is that you’re looking to add ETH as a collateral asset. They will pay a fee similar to the Maker system. And that fee will go to SNX holders?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Yeah that’s correct. So SNX holders provide the primary collateral and ETH in this case will form a secondary collateral pool with the idea that it would be a very easy on-ramp for someone holding ETH which is the majority of people in the Ethereum ecosystem to come and trade on the exchange. So you’re reading a newsletter or reading this interview and you go ‘Hm that centralised exchange index, that’s interesting. I want to short centralised exchanges, I think they are overpriced right now’. So they want to get exposure to the centralised exchange decline in price, they want to buy the inverse CEX token. At the moment there is a bit of friction to get that token. You can’t get it directly on Uniswap. If you’ve 50 ETH and want to take a 10,000 USD position short this token, you will be able to just turn up to the exchange, lock your ETH, open up a position and be short without having to sell your ETH for another asset. That opens up trading to a much wider range of people who might not want to sell ETH to get the exposure.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: Fantastic. One way to view this is that SNX holders get paid for minting. That’s very different from say Maker where users have to pay to mint Dai.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Correct. The difference I guess in the two systems is in Maker, demand for Dai comes from demand for leverage ETH. When people want to go long ETH, they open up a CDP, and now they got Dai, they can use that to go long ETH. That’s the main use case. Sometimes it is for people who wants to spend their ETH without having to sell their ETH but again, it is effectively a leveraged position. In our system, you lock SNX to provide a service, to join a distributed pool of people who are providing a service to traders, and you’re being paid for that service. So there are different supply and demand mechanisms between the systems. People are looking for demand for trading on the synthetic exchange as oppose to demand to go long on SNX.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: Makes sense. Over the long term, if SNX volatility goes down do you see the collateralisation ratio come down, currently at 750% and maybe the fee on the exchange can come down as well?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Yeah it is a very good question in that SNX is one of the most interesting tokens out there. The alignment between the token model and the incentives and the value capture is very tightly coupled. Probably more tightly coupled than any other asset out there. We don’t use a buy back and burn model or open market activities, it is genuinely activities happens and the fees for those activities are paid directly proportionately to your SNX holding and your staking. That creates a dynamic which at maturity, ideally when exchange volume grows you should be able to do a simple DCF with some core assumptions about growth and demand at the exchange to work out what the value of the asset should be. That makes Synthetix and different platform that a lot of token driven economies. Someone looking at that saying ‘I believe SNX based on the current yield is undervalued’ is a very different model to most tokens where it is not clear how to value those tokens apart from future demand. Ideally, over time the valuation model should stabilise to some range of values that people are accepting based on some assumptions. There is a secondary question of actual liquidity. Just because you can value something doesn’t mean it becomes liquid. You also need a lot of demand for people wanting to hold that asset. People wanting to trade it etc. But I think as valuation converge and people reach some kind of consensus what this thing should be worth, that should help with liquidity. But there is definitely other things that need to come along that as well to allow us to lower the collateralisation ratio. Right now it is very capital inefficient. When you look at Maker, it is a 150% collateralisation threshold and we are 750%. We want to get that down to maybe 250–200%, something like that but it is just going to take time.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: It strikes me that the Synthetix assets are in a way more trust minimised than say tokenised assets like tokenised gold. Here you don’t have to trust a real world issuer, it is all done with trust minimised technology and there is no external part to the system. Is that the way you see it as well? I guess there is different type of trust trade-offs.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Correct, there are always trade-offs. I think you trade the counter party risk for platform risk. If you look at something like Digix for example, if you trust that Digix will continue to allow conversion and redemption of gold and you trust that the gold in the vault in Singapore won’t be seized etc then the system is pretty much straightforward, there is not much systemic risk. In our system you got oracles, you got collateralisation ratio, you got SNX value so there are a whole lot of things that need to go right, so certainly in this early stage it is much higher risk than say fiat in a bank where you have a tokenised asset against that. But in the long term I think you’re right. Once you get to a level of maturity and the system has some stability in it, then definitely there is less trust required to hold these assets than a fiat backed or commodity backed token.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: So there is a trust in the software before it has been battle tested….</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Correct.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: … and oracles is a major part of that. They are giving the system prices from the real world. How are you solving that? Why was the decision made to move to Chainlink?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: When we launched the system back in April of 2018 there were no oracles. You really were forced to roll your own oracles which is obviously not ideal. Oracles are not our speciality, that would be a stretch or our imagination. We are good at solving hard engineering problems but oracles are a special category of engineering challenge. As we watched the market mature and saw different proposals come out, one that was very interesting to us was Chainlink I think for a number of reasons. They are a very pragmatic team, which is similar to our approach. We started working with them over six months ago now and they’ve worked very closely with us. We have very specific and somewhat challenging requirements for our oracles. They have been able to adapt their system and modify it to support our use case. Later this year when we go live with that, I think it will take a significant chunk of the risk out of our system and obviously there is always risk with any oracle system. Decoupling it so that there is no single point of failure is very powerful. We are very much looking forward to go live with Chainlink and get all our price feed migrated over. I think that will be a big next phase of the project.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: Talking about decisions, how is governance handled? Other projects like MakerDAO has an on-chain governance system. I guess that will be important as you decentralise. But you’re not very bullish on on-chain governance is that right?</p>
<p>By the way, I recommend everyone to listen to the latest gov call, it gives a good insight what you are working on and your team is really building at a breakneck speed. You can find a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sZlNlD7i3I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recording on Youtube</a>.</p>
<p class="">So how is governance working today and how do you see it working in the future?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: It would be very easy for me to say just lets move to on-chain governance. But the reality is that that would actually not solve anything. Right now the team maintains significant control over decision making although we’ve relaxed that a lot over the last year but ultimately we still have control over the protocol in a very real sense. If we’re to move to on-chain voting, the foundation has significant token holding and would very comfortable be able to swing every single vote. Which is the exact thing you’ve seen in things like Aragon and Maker where a single voter said we should move to 5.5% stability fee even though it is not really in the interest of every single Maker holder but for the overall Maker system. Then you get in to very interesting questions who should decide things, who are well informed and what are the strategies for that etc. I think forcing a slower governance system which rough consensus does and forcing a debate to evolve to a point where everyone as least in principle agrees on what we’re trying to achieve is very powerful. It creates a level of engagement and legitimise the decision. That you don’t have in on-chain voting. In on-chain voting systems you go ‘Well I throw my 1,000 tokens for this vote’ and then someone shows up with a million tokens that 1,000 people with a 1,000 tokens each can’t outvote. For the foreseeable we are not looking for on-chain governance but we are opening up governance, we’re trying to get people to engage, propose SIPs, Synthetix Improvement Proposals, and it’s working very well, we’re really happy with it. And interestingly in the last three months, there have been three different instances where I have had a view and the community have had a different view and the community has won. And that can’t happen if we’re doing on-chain voting for a whole bunch of reasons, participation etc. So I think again for the foreseeable future we need to let consensus evolve slowly to get to a point where almost everyone agrees instead of ramming something through with a token vote saying ‘No, this is what we’re doing’.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: How important is decentralisation at this stage, or do you think you’re still very early on and will decentralise at a later stage? Related to that, how do you see regulation play out and is decentralisation key there?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: I think it is absolutely critical. It is something that is very high on my radar in terms of the things that we’re focusing on. We have done some initial R&amp;D into ways that we can move some of the low hanging fruit to a more decentralised process. Again we don’t want to to be window dressing, for it to be theater. It needs to be genuinely implemented in a way that makes the system more decentralised. We could easily open up a multi-sig and add a couple of extra signers from the community but in our view that would be doing very little because the core team would still have control. In order for us to hand over protocol governance to a wider group of people we need some kind of DAO like function. That’s something we are looking to implement hopefully in the next two to three months where we have a DAO that have some level of control over the protocol. There is a open proposal I put out for a decentralised proxy contract. Aragon actually have something quite similar. Essentially what we want to have is not having unilateral control over how the protocol operates. So we will propose upgrades and those proposals will contain certain upgrades to contracts. That will be open on-chain so people will be able to see all the logic that is in there and they will be able to make decisions. Now the question is how do you enforce those decisions? Ideally what we would like to have is a DAO that is not only managed by the core team but a number of community members such that the community members could over rule the core team. At that point you’ve stepped away from three people in a room making decision things to the whole community actually making decisions. That a big next phase for the project.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: There are a lot DeFi projects out there. The beautiful thing is that these are composable assets, these Synth assets are ERC-20 tokens. So you can trade them on Uniswap. Perhaps you will be able to earn and yield on these assets on lending markets etc. Do you see this as key in the future to be an integral part of the DeFi ecosystem?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Yeah for sure. That’s something we’ve seen really accelerate in the past two, three months. There are a number of different projects that have built things. DexWallet is a good example. They just won the Kyber Hackathon for the ‘DeFi Recipes’ that they are building which allows you to take interest from Dai and pool it into different macro approaches such as long ETH, short ETH, long Bitcoin etc and they’re using synthetic assets to do that.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: That’s really interesting.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: We have something like SET protocols where you in a similar way can have different strategies, they could potentially use synthetic assets.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Correct.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: What’s your overall vision with this project say in the next 5 years, is it to be able to trade any kind of asset in a permissionless way for anyone in the world?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Yes I think in the early phase of the project in the next 6 to 12 months, the majority of the demand in DeFi projects will come from crypto people, crypto natives. Our goal is not just to build a project that support a whole lot of use cases but to also get demand for those kind of use cases as well. In the short term we see demand mainly coming from trading, that’s where most of the activity is happening. So if we can integrate and build a lot of assets in the protocol like Synthetic Positions that people want to trade that will significantly increase the usability of the platform. We can take some market share from centralised derivatives and futures exchanges. If we can pull some of that market share away. Uniswap has demonstrated that DEXes are functional and can support these use cases. I think that’s going to be a huge step in the right direction. Once we got that demand and once we built the project to a level of maturity then the question is where do we focus. Do we focus on enabling functions for people who have a mobile phone but not a bank account? That’s something we will have to let the market decide. Ultimately the project and its tokens holders will decide that because at the time we get to that point, we will be far more decentralised than what we are now and it will come down to what does the community believe is the right decision to focus on.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: Do you believe at some point people will build consumer facing applications on top of the Synthetix protocol?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: 100%.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: Something we haven’t touch on is how the project is funded, you obviously sold tokens earlier. How do you see long term funding for the project. And what is the basis you operate from now, do you have a non-for profit foundation behind Synthetix?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Yeah so that’s an interesting thing. We started up a foundation. The token sale was run out of Singapore and we sat up a non-for profit foundation which currently governs the protocol. Our view is that that whole foundation model is probably a bit obsolete now. It arouse from 2013-2015 — early projects saying how shall we govern this thing? And back then there wasn’t the tooling to support a decentralised governance structure. But ultimately tokens themselves are representation of ownership of the protocol. We need to find a way to let the protocol be owned by the token holders without going to necessary pure on-chain voting. So some kind of governance that support that. Eventually we would like to wind up those entities. You don’t need a legal foundation — there is just a DAO that is governed by token holders. All of the funds that have been raised will sit in that DAO. They will be distributed via a grants process and you really don’t need a legal entity. Obviously downstream you might have legal entities that apply for those grants. You might have a consultancy firm in South America that propose to build some aspect of the system. They apply for a grant, the funds are distributed from the DAO through some kind of voting mechanism or consensus and the grant is paid. They go do the work and that’s it. That kind of mechanism is possible today but wasn’t really possible back in 2014–2015, you needed accounts and all kind of things. We want to be the first project to move to be really decoupled from the legacy financial system.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: Wow so that’s really cool. So once you’re fully decentralised those legal entities becomes unnecessary.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: Correct.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: A final question, sometimes you hear that you might not need a native token. You obviously have SNX. I actually believe that is helping you build a strong community and network — what’s your view on that?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: I think if you have a native token that is not aligned with the incentives then it is a huge liability. Conversely, if you have a token with well aligned incentives that captures activity and enables a group of distributed people around the world to come together and agree to provide some kind of service within some structure and ruleset then that’s really powerful and that’s what tokens really should be doing. They should enable these kind of new entities to provide services to the market without needing a hierarchical legal entity sitting there providing the service. I think over the next 2–3 years that’s what we will see, we will see token models revamped. We are already seeing it, for example 0X looking at staking incentives. Despite the fact that we got a lot of things wrong in 2016, my genuine sense is that tokens are here to stay, we just have to get better at designing them and we will be able to build some systems that are really robust and not be able to be captured and deliver powerful outcomes.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Henrik</strong>: Agree. I think we covered a lot of ground here. Did I miss anything important about Synthetix?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Kain</strong>: No, I think we covered everything. We like to make sure we really highlight the risks. The fact that this a very early stage, fast moving project. It is something that is not necessary easy to get your head around but something that is worth the effort.

<p class="">Numerai started out as a hedge fund that used Blockchain and crypto to crowdsource predictions from data scientists around the world. Erasure is a middleware protocol on top of the Ethereum network.</p>
<p class="">Numerai the hedge fund trades traditional instruments like stocks based on quantitative models. A quant hedge fund would normally employ a number of math PhDs to develop and optimise the trading models for the fund. Instead Numerai is using crypto incentives to crowdsource this work. Data scientists participate in monthly tournaments by submitting predictions based on encrypted financial variables. Winning participants is rewarded in NMR tokens. The encrypted data are normalised and cleaned, looking like this:</p>

<p class="">As a hedge fund you don’t want to give away the data for others to work on. That’s why the data is obfuscated through encryption. The trick here is using a novel kind of encryption to preserve the structure of the data even as it is encrypted. This means that the data scientists around the world can build models to make predictions on this encrypted data. Thanks to encryption and crypto incentive models like staking, Numerai is able to crowd source machine learning data scientist from around the world. The result is that Numerai doesn’t have to give up their proprietary data and the data scientist don’t have to give up their models, only their predictions.</p>
<p class="">So far Numerai has paid out over US$6.5M in rewards and Numerai has been one of the most used protocols on Ethereum while backed by some of the most prominent investors in the space like Union Square Ventures, the cofounder of Renaissance (one of the top hedge funds in the world) and the cofounder of Coinbase.</p>
<p class="">While Numerai is really impressive and innovative, we felt that optimising on running a hedge fund, Numerai, wasn’t the right fit for our fund with its primary focus on open finance infrastructure projects. Numerai was too narrow and too centralised for our liking. That’s why we were very pleased to see the announcement of the next phase of Numerai; Erasure.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Erasure</strong></p>
<p class="">Erasure is an open platform for data prediction that can be used by anyone. By having participants create an immutable record of predictions on a blockchain, coupled with skin in the game in form of staking, Erasure creates a general market place for all kind of data that is open to anyone in world. There are huge amounts of data in the world but the good predictions can’t easily be leveraged and potential buyers of those predictions don’t have a reliable way of measuring accuracy over time. Erasure effectively allows anyone to time-stamp data, allowing people to develop an immutable data record. Further, participants can signal their belief in the data by staking NMR.</p>
<p class="">Numerai built the first two applications on top of Erasure, ErasureQuant and ErasureBay.</p>
<p class=""><strong>ErasureQuant </strong>is a stock market prediction market on top of Erasure. Anyone can submit a prediction of a stock in Russell 3000, that prediction is encrypted and sent to IPFS (a decentralised file storage protocol), while a hash is committed to the Ethereum blockchain. Over time you can create an immutable record that combined with staking prevents you from submitting multiple conflicting predictions. ErasureQuant is live and usable today, you can check it out at <a href="http://erasurequant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ErasureQuant.com</a>.</p>
<p class="">Anyone can build their own markets on top of the Erasure protocol and Numerai recently put up a grant of $1M for developers to do just this.</p>

<p class=""><strong>ErasureBay</strong> (deriving its name from The Pirate Bay) was the second market on Erasure that was announced. While the core building blocks are the same as ErasureQuant (IPFS, Ethereum and staking of NMR), ErasureBay is a general purpose data market, not necessary finance related. ErasureBay is designed to allow innovative uses for general purpose data time-stamping to create an immutable record.</p>
<p class="">With the Internet, data were let free, it became widely available to almost everyone in the world. ErasureBay is trying to solve the trust issues — i.e. which data should we trust. It is hard to predict what kind of data ErasureBay will be most used for. Will it be used by the next generation of stock pickers or whistleblowers. Perhaps the next Edward Snowden will use ErasureBay to build trust with the public.</p>

<p class="">Numerai recently made a <a href="https://medium.com/numerai/redesigning-ethereums-most-used-token-96c9fa885352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public promise</a> to quickly decentralise as much as possible while reducing the total supply of NMR — which is at the centre of everything in this new emerging ecosystem. The ethos and decentralisation of Numerai is quickly getting recognised by some of the top crypto companies. The <a href="https://www.cryptoratingcouncil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crypto Rating Council</a> classifies crypto assets on the likelihood of them being securities. A rating of 1 means an asset has no resembles of a security while a 5 strongly suggest it is a security. Notably, Numerai scored a 2 — indicating it has little resemblance to a security. Only pure cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin scored lower.</p>
<p class="">In summary, we have always been fascinated by Numerai’s clever use of structure-preserving encryption and with the launch of their new platform Erasure coupled with the team’s strong ethos of decentralisation and track record of delivering, Numerai has a clear a place in our portfolio.</p>

<div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1626311306172_204" class="sqs-block-content">
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1626311306172_203" class=""><em id="yui_3_17_2_1_1626311306172_202">This is the first instalment of a series we call Investment Highlights where we briefly describe some of our current portfolio investments.</em></p>
<p class="">If we define Bitcoin as a first generation blockchain and Ethereum as second generation, then Algorand could be defined as third generation. Algorand was founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Micali" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silvio Micali</a>, a Turing award winning cryptographer and professor of computer science at MIT.</p>
<p class="">Algorand’s consensus algorithm is called Pure Proof-of-Stake. At its core is something called a VRF or a ‘Verifiable Random Function’. Micali, Algorand’s founder, was involved in introducing this cryptographic primitive in 1999. Much of Algorand’s security, scalability and decentralisation properties are thanks to this VRF (Dfinity, is another Apollo investment that utilises this primitive in its consensus algorithm). For each block, the VRF essentially selects a random set containing 1,000 tokens where holders validate the block. Each block is produced in below 5 seconds. The result is a protocol with potentially a very attractive set of tradeoffs between fast confirmations, robustness and security (Algorand requires that 2/3 of participants are honest). Despite being a Proof-of-Stake network, Algorand doesn’t have slashing as they don’t feel this is necessary to protect against bad behaviour. In our discussions with Algorand they do seem to be flexible on this point — this is something that could be implemented down the line if required.</p>
<p class="">To keep the network as lightweight as possible and to avoid unwanted complexity, Algorand will try to do more in layer 1 instead of at the level of turing complete smart contracts (layer 2). In our dialogue with Algorand, they expressed a goal to replicate ~95% of the functionality of current Ethereum use cases with layer 1 technology.</p>
<p class="">While Algorand has been <a href="https://twitter.com/GenMeasures/status/1167392183407669248?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticised</a> for not being completely permissionless, it is our understanding that they do have a strong emphasis on quickly becoming highly permissionless and decentralised. While a non for-profit foundation in Singapore governs the network, they have a for profit company in Algorand LLC which will provide support services to the network à la the Linux/Red Hat model.</p>

<p class="">The goal of Algorand is to <strong>‘democratize finance’</strong>. This is an ambitious goal that falls well within our <a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2019/6/4/investment-thesisnbsprefresh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investment Thesis</a>. Our sense is that Algorand will initially focus on tokenised assets, stablecoins and different types of financial contracts.</p>
<p class="">Since the network went live in June, there has been an impressive list of announcement from Algorand in a short period of time:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Tether has <a href="https://tether.to/tether-coming-to-algorand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> they are integrating with the Algorand Protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""><a href="https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/algorand-isda-member" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISDA membership</a> to enable financial organisations to use their existing templates and tools to easily create decentralised financial instruments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""><a href="https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/fungible-tokens-and-atomic-multi-party-transfers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposal</a> to implement new fungible tokens and execution of atomic multi-party transfers (AMPTs) in layer 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-08-27/algo-capital-closes-algo-vc-fund-at-200-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New 200M VC fund</a>, Algo VC Fund, focused on the Algorand blockchain platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">IDEX, the leading DEX on Ethereum, <a href="https://blog.idex.io/all-posts/idex-plans-for-next-generation-decentralized-exchange-on-algorand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will work on implementing a platform on Algorand</a> using its layer 1 technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="">Apart from the above list, Algorand has shown impressive agility and innovation when it comes to token economics. Their first Dutch token auction in June contained an interesting buy back mandate. Algorand since then implemented an early redemption program for auction participants as well as a 200 million Algorand staking program. Talking to the team, it is clear that the 3bn Algorand to be injected into the ecosystem via auctions and other means will be done so over a <em>minimum </em>of 5 years. We also note that there has been a recent proposal to extend the token distribution to relay node runners from 2 years to 5 years which should, if accepted, lessen sell pressure in the medium term.</p>
<p class="">Algorand has a place in our portfolio as a base layer 1 blockchain that nicely balances a number of attractive tradeoffs and has so far impressed us with what they brought to market in a relatively short time frame.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1623053164602_706" class="">In September 2018, the Apollo Capital Fund made a seed investment into Dfinity, which was described as <a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2018/9/4/apollo-capital-a16z-crypto-polychain-among-investors-indfinity">“the most exciting project of 2018”</a>. The foundation behind the Internet Computer (ICP), The Dfinity Foundation, has raised over US$200 million from top-tier crypto investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital. After two and a half years of gruelling development, the ambitious project has successfully launched with their Internet Computer (ICP) token listing on top exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Huobi.</p>
<p class="">Internet Computer currently trades at US$112 with a market capitalisation of US$14 billion, representing a 23x return for the Capital Fund, and ranking ICP as the 11th largest crypto asset <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/internet-computer">according to Coingecko</a>.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Founder &amp; Vision</strong></p>
<p class="">The Internet Computer is spearheaded by Dfinity’s highly capable Founder and Chief Scientist, Dominic Williams. Dominic has had a distinguished career as a crypto theoretician and serial entrepreneur focused on the Internet and distributed systems. His scientific discoveries across Threshold Relay chains, PSC chains and many other innovations have pioneered new approaches to cryptography and blockchain technology.</p>
<p class="">A key underpinning of Domenic’s success is his unmistakably bold vision for the project. “Our mission is to push towards a blockchain singularity, where the majority of the world’s systems and services are created using smart contracts, and run entirely on chain, a transformation that will take years”. While Domenic’s slightly audacious claims about the potential of the project have received some scepticism from the wider crypto community, the attention grabbing valuation of ICP demonstrates that there is no shortage of big VC’s that share the vision and believe in Domenic.</p>

<p class=""><strong>The Protocol </strong></p>
<p class="">The Internet Computer does not aim to directly compete with existing blockchains but instead break new ground by reinventing and decentralising the Web stack. If the project is successful, it will bring an abundance of viable new use cases to the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p class="">The problem Dfinity is addressing extends beyond just blockchain technology. It aims to build a decentralized, scalable cloud-like platform that can store data, perform computation, and support community-driven governance. Dfinity wants the internet itself to support software applications and data, rather than simply providing peer-to-peer connections and relying on proprietary cloud-hosting services to handle the rest.</p>
<p class="">The Internet Computer’s version of smart contracts (known as “canisters”) are very different to the smart contracts that existing blockchain communities are familiar with. Canisters run at web speed, can serve web experiences directly to end users providing end-to-end blockchain security, can be used to create scalable dapps, and can process and store data at relatively stable cost that is a tiny fraction of that on traditional blockchain.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Protocol Interoperability</strong></p>
<p class=""><a href="https://medium.com/dfinity/internet-computer-ethereum-integration-explained-6967456e35f9">In a recent blog post</a>, Dominic Williams explores the opportunities of direct interoperability between the Internet Computer and the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p class=""><em>“For example, you can imagine that a DeFi system running on Ethereum might use smart contracts on the Internet Computer to securely serve user experience to end users, rather than using an insecure website hosted on the Amazon Web Services cloud — which forces end-users to trust the website operator is honest, that AWS is honest, and that the account has not been hacked, such that they can never really be sure they are even interacting with smart contracts. This simple potential application of integration hints at the possibilities. The combination of the two networks will be incredibly powerful.” </em></p>
<p class="">The potential for the Internet Computer to compliment existing blockchains through interoperability is an exciting development in the blockchain ecosystem. These inter-protocol synergies will enable innovative new decentralised application (dapp) structures to emerge that boost immutability, decentralisation and security.</p>
<p class="">In March 2021, two well known DeFi protocols operating on the Binance Smart Chain suffered domain name service (DNS) attacks, causing their websites to become inaccessible for hours. This event highlighted that decentralised finance is still reliant on many centralised entities and solutions that are a potential point of failure.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1623053164602_711" class="">While we believe the current valuation of ICP is a relatively accurate representation of the protocol’s core value and potential, as a recently launched project it is also widely accepted that the Internet Computer has a long way to go until the underlying vision is achieved. We are excited to see how the Internet Computer develops over the coming years and believe that ICP compliments our layer 1 blockchain portfolio. Our successful investment into Dfinity in 2018 demonstrates the asymmetrical return potential of our &#8216;early stage investments&#8217; portfolio.</p>
