										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This article will be covering the events that lead to the de-pegging of Terra&#8217;s (LUNA) native stablecoin UST and, ultimately the sharp and swift devaluation of Terra&#8217;s governance token LUNA of -99.99% over the past three days.</p>
<p>Before deep-diving into the events, it is helpful to understand how Luna and UST operate. UST is an algorithmic stablecoin native to the Terra ecosystem, and LUNA is the native governance token. Both have a symbiotic relationship whereby they operate on a 1:1 redemptions system. UST can be minted by burning the LUNA token, or the LUNA can be redeemed by converting the UST back. Reliance on the market value of the LUNA and UST requires self-reciprocating faith in both the algorithmic stability and the governance token. It is important to note that Terra&#8217;s native borrowing and lending platform, Anchor, has been offering DeFi users a ~20% APY on deposited UST for the past 14 months.</p>
<p><strong>UST De-Pegging</strong></p>
<p>On May 9th, a significant outflow occurred with ~$5B worth of UST withdrawing from Anchor. To get &#8216;out&#8217; of UST in this situation, investors had three options;</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the algorithmic minting function whereby they burn $1 of UST to redeem $1 of LUNA.</li>
<li>Swap out of UST using Curve&#8217;s 3CRV liquidity pool, which had roughly 550M liquidity</li>
<li>Deposit onto a centralised exchange and swap directly</li>
</ol>
<p>With the reserves for the LUNA algorithmic minting function capped at ~300M per day out of the ~2B in total reserves and the 3CRV pool being ~550M in total liquidity, billions of UST were forced onto centralised exchanges to be sold. The tremendous selling pressure caused UST to de-peg significantly, trading at $0.61 on May 10th.</p>
<p>With a significant disparity between the reserves needed to maintain the UST peg outweighed by the billions of UST wanting to exit the ecosystem, UST has not been able to recover its peg after May 9th.</p>

<div></div>
<div>
<p><b>LUNA Capitulation</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of UST de-pegging, traders began using the algorithm as an arbitrage opportunity. This is precisely how the algorithm is intended to function. However, in this instance, it contributed to a significant downward spiral for the price of LUNA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The algorithmic function to assist in stabilising the price of LUNA and UST is built so that arbitragers can sell UST when one unit is worth less than $1 to redeem $1 worth of LUNA, thereby increasing the LUNA supply and diluting the price of LUNA holders. This function works very well during normal market conditions to maintain UST&#8217;s peg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By May 12th, we can see a dramatic acceleration in the supply of LUNA, causing a strong decline in its price. It is worth noting that LUNA&#8217;s supply is infinite under these tokenomics.</span></p>
</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1429 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA-1024x531.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="389" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA-1024x531.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA-768x398.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA-1536x796.jpg 1536w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA-1568x813.jpg 1568w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Messari-LUNA.jpg 1848w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Effects on Apollo</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, these events have been felt across all Apollo’s Funds, which has caused a loss of approximately ~5% in both our long funds holding LUNA and ~9% in the market neutral funds holding UST. We are grateful that our risk management framework has contained the losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The events over the last three day can be likened to a &#8220;black swan&#8221; event. Over the past 12 months, the Terra ecosystem has developed into a thriving DeFi ecosystem with significant backing from some of the most reputable institutions and investors in the crypto asset industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Apollo team has reacted by successfully selling the majority of any UST positions at 80c. While this realises a 20% loss on these positions, it has proven to be a prudent trade as UST now trades closer to 0. The Apollo team has sought to de-risk exposure in the market neutral funds and has exited other stablecoins that might carry similar risks to UST.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, we continue to monitor market developments very closely and will keep investors informed.</span></p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1623053384372_231" class="">Over the past two weeks there has been immense volatility in the crypto markets with Bitcoin and Ethereum correcting -50% and -61% peak-to-trough respectively since the 10th of May. While long term crypto asset investors are no strangers to major corrections, this market wide sell off was particularly brutal. In this article we will outline the major news stories that contributed to the market panic and discuss whether these developments will have a lasting impact on the fundamentals of the asset class.</p>
<p class="">Before we dig into the news events that contributed to the recent volatility, it is worth pointing out that crypto markets were in need of a correction. Crypto markets operate with a significant amount of leverage due to the fact that retail investors are able to access 50-100 times leverage instantly through centralised exchanges such as ByBit, Binance and FTX. In this bull cycle, these exchanges have branched out into offering leverage on a wider variety of alternative coins, causing smaller coins to experience greater price swings in both directions. The volatility across the entire crypto asset market on the 19th of May was a liquidation driven event as this excessive leverage was flushed out of the system. Overall, we view these corrections as being good for the medium term health of the market and great for investors on the sidelines who are looking to enter the market.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p>
<p class="">On the 13th of May, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin as payment for electric vehicles due to concerns over Bitcoin mining energy consumption. Elon’s tweet caused the price of Bitcoin to plummet -16% in just 3 hours and sparked fierce debate about the environmental impact of the coin. Following this initial tweet, the “Doge Father” continued to provoke his large twitter following by suggesting that he would sell Tesla&#8217;s BTC holdings and that he would instead accept DOGE as payment for electric vehicles. While neither of these scenarios have been formally announced, there is no shortage of speculative traders looking to trade in anticipation of Elon’s tweets.</p>

<p class=""><strong>China</strong></p>
<p class="">The Chinese crypto community has seen two large-scale crackdowns over the last decade. China’s central bank first banned financial institutions from offering services related to Bitcoin in 2013 and expanded the ban to all crypto assets and initial coin offerings in 2017. Despite these crackdowns, crypto trading has persisted in the region and China is recognised as the largest miner of Bitcoin in the world.</p>
<p class="">In the past week, China has issued two announcements about crypto assets. The first is a warning pointed at Chinese commercial banks and payment companies who have been friendly to crypto- related businesses. <a href="https://decrypt.co/71656/bitcoin-crashes-12-as-china-reiterates-mining-crackdown">The second is Bitcoin mining related</a>.</p>
<p class=""><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-beijings-new-crackdown-means-crypto-china-2021-05-19/">The first announcement</a> came on Wednesday the 19th where the National Internet Finance Association of China, the China Banking Association and the Payment and Clearing Association of China published a notice saying member financial institutions should not provide services to crypto-related transactions or investment funds. This notice was a reiteration of the existing ban, but many media outlets misrepresented this announcement as being a new ban which contributed to the volatility and panic on the day.</p>
<p class="">Three days later, China&#8217;s financial committee added Bitcoin mining as a key sector to crackdown on in an attempt to &#8220;resolutely prevent and control financial risks.&#8221; While the report included a list of activities beyond Bitcoin mining, this was the first time that the State Council has explicitly spoken out on Bitcoin mining. Sources suggest that the crackdown on Bitcoin miners will be limited to coal-powered operations, which is an overall positive given the effect of Elon Musk’s comments.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Joe Biden</strong></p>
<p class="">The last major news event that contributed to the volatility seen over the past 2 weeks was The Treasury Department of the United States proposing that businesses must file a current transaction report when they receive cryptocurrency worth more than $10,000, just as most businesses are required to report cash payments of more than $10,000. The proposal is relatively insignificant to the current crypto market as it will not come into action until 2023. However, headlines such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2021/05/20/biden-tax-enforcement-plan-includes-crypto-reporting-crackdown/?sh=127e5e126425">“Biden Tax Enforcement Plan Includes Crypto Reporting Crackdown”</a> spooked the market at first glance.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1623053384372_234" class="">After digging into the details of these developments, it is clear that there have been no fundamental changes to the crypto asset market. We maintain the view that the panic seen on the 19th of May presents a unique opportunity to enter the market. In comparison to similar drawdowns seen in the 2017 ICO bubble, crypto is no longer an abstract bet on the future, but a growing reality all around us. The recent flushing out of the excessive leverage in the crypto markets will enable crypto assets to experience more organic growth going forward.</p>

<p class="">Excitingly, valuation of crypto assets are starting to look more and more like traditional cash flow valuation, especially with the rise of what we call Work Tokens. This is a follow-on to our earlier piece <a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2019/5/14/a-new-crypto-valuation-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A New Crypto Valuation Framework</a></p>
<p class="">We find that most crypto assets falls in one of several of the below categories. As an example, Bitcoin clearly falls in the first category as an emerging form of Digital Gold but simultaneously it is clearly also used as a currency, and as such falls in the third category.</p>

<p class="">Let’s take a closer look at the different categories and the different models that are applicable for each.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Crypto-commodities, Bitcoin</strong></p>
<p class="">As frequently mentioned, Bitcoin has favourable properties as an emergent Digital Gold. While Gold’s supply on earth is fixed but unknown, Bitcoin’s supply is known and fixed at 21 millions.</p>
<p class="">One of the most attractive models we have seen that captures the increased scarcity in Bitcoin in relation to its market capitalisation is the Stock-to-Flow model by <a href="https://medium.com/u/bcb63a182704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlanB</a>. The graph below captures the essence of that <a href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/bitcoin-stock-to-flow-cross-asset-model-50d260feed12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">model</a>. As a store-of-value like commodity becomes increasingly scarce, its value tends to follow the regression line in the graph, up and to the right.</p>

<p class="">While this dynamic has proven to be valid so far, there are other dynamics in play as well. In our eyes, due to its superior properties Bitcoin is likely to capture market share away from Gold over time.</p>

<p class="">If that’s indeed the case, Gold will over time move to below the regression line in the graph above. Market share can flow from the close to $10 trillion asset that is Gold to its much smaller digital version which is Bitcoin at $130 billion.</p>
<p class="">While the store-of-value narrative in crypto is dominated by Bitcoin, other assets are also showing signs of ‘moneyness’ such as Ethereum’s ether.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Work Tokens</strong></p>
<p class="">These are tokens that serve a particular function— they reward a certain work — and there is a payment compensating for that work. We have seen a growth in this kind of on-chain cash flow, especially in the important DeFi vertical.</p>
<p class="">Let’s take an example to illustrate what we mean. <a href="http://makerdao.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MakerDAO</a> is a two-token system consisting of Dai, a stablecoin pegged to the USD and Maker, a governance token. The Maker is used to pay for the interest charged for participants who create or mint Dai. Those Maker tokens that are collected are removed from the ecosystem. In this way, the cash flow in Maker is very similar to a stock buyback. The work Maker token holders perform is not just as governors, but also by backstopping the system in case of a default.</p>
<p class="">There is a growing ecosystem of these work tokens that all have some form of on-chain cash flow. It is fundamentally no different valuing this cash flow than the cash flow from a stock.</p>
<p class="">The website <a href="https://www.tokenterminal.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Token Terminal</a> captures the earnings for some of these networks and their associated work tokens.</p>

<p class="">It is possible to do a NPV calculation, or a calculate simple PE-ratio for work tokens tied to an on-chain cash flow.</p>
<p class="">One interesting observation is that these earning are ‘higher up’ in the income statement that traditional earnings from companies. Since there is no cost items associated to this cash flows, they in this sense resemble a claim on revenues which is more valuable than net earnings.</p>
<p class="">Another important point is that all crypto investing resemble early stage investing. As such, making ‘earnings’ forecasts for these tokens is fraught with uncertainty. The earlier you invest the more important other factors become such as credibility of team and the design and differentiated features of the proposed network. Research has shown that as this stage you will want a broad exposure to a number of assets that can appreciate by a very large factor.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Utility Tokens</strong></p>
<p class="">Looking at crypto assets as currencies is one of the earliest approaches to crypto asset valuation. The equation of exchange states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">M*V=P*Q</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">, where M is the Monetary value, V the velocity, P the price of a good and Q the quantity of the good.</p>
<p class=""><a href="https://woobull.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Willy Woo</a> created the NVT-ratio in order to visualise the relationship between the Network Value (our M in the equation above) and Transaction Value (P times Q), the NVT-ratio is the inverse monetary velocity:</p>

<p class="">While our traditional fiat currencies belongs to this category, we believe pure crypto asset utility tokens will face a tough time. Part of the reason for that is that the typical token value for a utility token is only a fraction of the transactional value on that network.</p>
<p class="">While Bitcoin’s value is tilted to the first category as a potential store-of-value, we see some of the most interesting opportunities in crypto asset investing in the second category, work tokens with an on-chain cash flow.</p>

<p class="">A wave of skepticism and scrutiny has followed Libra’s announcement in June this year. Almost everyone has jumped on board the ‘bash Facebook’ train.</p>
<p class="">Last week Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the House Financial Services Committee for a six-hour hearing on Libra.</p>
<p class="">Surprisingly, indirect help for Libra’s project came a few days after the hearing, from the most unlikely of sources.</p>
<p class="">__</p>
<p class="">Libra initially announced with 28 founding member organisations that would form the initial Libra Association. The plan was to start with 28 initial member organisations and grow to 100, with no one organisation in control.</p>
<p class="">The reasons were clear for launching Libra as a consortium rather than one company such as Facebook. A highly valued characteristic of crypto assets is a certain threshold of decentralisation. At Apollo Capital, we carefully analyse the level to which a crypto asset is decentralised, seeing greater risk in assets that are too centralised. Unlike fiat currencies which can be debased by central banks or censored by oppressive States, valuable crypto assets typically cannot be controlled by one central actor. Libra’s goal to grow to 100 members is an attempt to demonstrate that it is sufficiently decentralised. Libra is not Facebook’s project, Facebook is merely one member.</p>
<p class="">Two weeks ago the Libra Association formed with 21 member organisations. 7 dropped out since the initial announcement. A number of commentators have used this to suggest that the project is on shaky grounds. Our view is that a number of members decided to drop out because of the backlash against Facebook and the project. A few companies including Visa, Mastercard and Stripe received letters from Senators asking them to rethink their involvement in Libra. If they didn’t, their existing business would come under intense scrutiny from regulators.</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">Last week, the spotlight on Libra and Facebook intensified as Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the House Financial Services Committee. Before we analyse the questions and answers, let’s stop and ask why Zuckerberg, if Facebook is only one member of the Libra Association? The answer to this is three-fold. First, it appears that Facebook has led the Libra charge. Initial job posts were made by Facebook as long as one year ago. Second, if politicians were looking to beat up the Libra project, Zuckerberg makes the perfect scapegoat. Third, Facebook have plans to develop Calibra, a wallet that can be used to send and store Libra tokens.</p>
<p class="">What did we learn from Zuck’s appearance?</p>
<p class="">While it was an ideal opportunity to learn more about Libra, unfortunately the episode was largely political. A number of members of Congress used the opportunity to grandstand and showboat, probing Zuckerberg about the Cambridge Analytica scandal and all the problems facing Facebook. One even asked Zuckerberg if vaccines were 100% safe and accused his platform of burying content from anti-vaxxers.</p>
<p class="">In amongst the rubble of political showmanship, there were some interesting insights into the concerns of politicians, as well as responses from Zuckerberg.</p>
<p class="">One such concern was the <strong>potential threat from Libra to the US Dollar. </strong></p>
<p class="">“The dollar is very important to us as a tool, a tool of American power and also a tool of American values. We would much prefer to put sanctions on a country than send our soldiers there….When something threatens the dollar, we get very nervous”</p>
<p class="">Of course the power of the US Dollar isn’t just limited to a tool of influence, there are also financial concerns at losing the “money [that] pours into the US because of this.”</p>
<p class="">Republican Brad Sherman was perhaps Zuckerberg’s sharpest critic, comparing the functionality of Libra to the functionality of the US Dollar: “<strong>You’re trying to help those for whom the dollar is not a good currency: drug dealers, terrorists, tax evaders</strong>.” Referencing Libra’s initial aims of helping the unbanked, which admittedly Zuckerberg did less this time around, Congressman Sherman was on the front foot:: “the richest man in the world to come here and hide behind the poorest people in the world”</p>
<p class="">Republican Maxine Waters pointed out that Facebook initially banned crypto ads because they are “frequently associated with misleading and deceptive practices.” Facebook then reversed their decision, bought a blockchain company and announced Libra. “Tell us what changed. How did crypto currency go from misleading and deceptive last year, to become a means for financial inclusion this year. You change your policy when it benefits you.”</p>
<p class="">Not all committee members were negative. Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota lent this support to the project, calling his colleagues’ ominous tone disappointing and expressing support for financial innovation.</p>
<p class="">How did Zuckerberg respond?</p>
<p class="">First, he admitted that Facebook isn’t the ideal messenger right now.</p>
<p class="">In response to the questions about the threat to the US Dollar, he landed a solid rebuke saying “<strong>if America doesn’t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.</strong>”</p>
<p class="">Zuckerberg repeatedly said Libra will not launch until it obtains the necessary approvals from US regulators. A number of committee members suggested he was bluffing, asking which regulators that will include. Zuckerberg deflected. Either he is genuine and there is a risk of Facebook leaving the Libra Association, or he and his lawyers know that there are indeed no significant regulatory hurdles.</p>
<p class="">There were suggestions of a design change to Libra. Initially the Libra coin would be backed by a basket of fiat currencies. We previously heard rumours which were strengthened during the hearing that there is a possibility that Libra might only be backed by USD, there will be a minimum percentage of US Dollar backing or there might be multiple crypto currencies for multiple fiat currencies. Some commentators have suggested that in light of concerns of the threat to the US Dollar, they will be surprised to see the basket of currencies survive.</p>
<p class=""><strong>We remain convinced that Libra will be a boon for crypto assets</strong>. Libra’s user base, their expertise in design and the attention surrounding the project will surely lead to greater crypto exposure and adoption. However, to say Libra faces an uphill battle would be an understatement. The regulatory scrutiny from politicians and regulators in the US and around the world continues to grow. Facebook has been unable to separate its poor image and reputation from the project, especially as it relates to privacy. The project is as much Facebook’s as it is the Libra Association’s, in a clear case of perception being greater than reality.</p>
<p class="">Zuckerberg also played the China card in his remarks, urging regulators to act quickly &#8220;While we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn&#8217;t waiting. China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months,&#8221; he said</p>
<p class="">It was no coincidence that over the weekend, only days after Zuckerberg’s remarks, <strong>Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China said China should seize the opportunity to adopt blockchain</strong>. “We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies.”</p>
<p class="">This adds to reports that a digital renminbi is being developed by the Central bank and is likely to be launched by the end of the year. China’s central bank will distribute the digital renminbi to seven institutions, from where these institutions will begin circulating the token to Chinese people.</p>
<p class="">The potential impact of this on crypto is also enormous, introducing crypto assets to China’s 1.3bn people. Bitcoin and Blockchain searches on Baidu (China’s Google equivalent) jumped significantly over the weekend. Perhaps this will have a greater impact on crypto than Libra.</p>
<p class="">It is unclear how President Trump and US politicians will respond to President Xi Jinping’s comments. Perhaps they will be brushed aside. Or perhaps the US just got the kick up the bum it needed, and the Libra Association just found their greatest cause for support.</p>

<p class="">Crypto valuation is still a nascent and evolving subject. With something radically new like crypto it is easy to fall into the trap of trying to fit it into the framework of something familiar. Instead we believe crypto assets are be a diverse set of different type of assets, with different valuation frameworks. Most crypto assets won’t fit squarely into one bucket but will have properties that span across multiple different types of assets.</p>
<p class="">Over the past 12 months our understanding of the subject has evolved primarily when it comes to the token type that is becoming known as ‘Work Tokens’. This is how we currently map out the space on a high level:</p>

<p class="">Note that the above table doesn’t include Security Tokens. These are a traditional asset class represented by a crypto token, thus fall into the left column even though they are represented by a crypto token.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Crypto-commodities, Bitcoin</strong></p>
<p class="">Bitcoin can be thought of as a digital gold. It shares many properties with gold such as being scarce while Bitcoin’s properties are superior (easily divisible, transportable, stored, secured etc). It is probably no coincident that a similar system to Bitcoin proposed by Nick Szabo but not implemented was called Bit Gold.</p>
<p class="">It is not clear how to value a store of value like Gold, but it clearly has value as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. This is also the reason why practically all central banks have gold in their reserves.</p>
<p class="">In a way, Bitcoin is closing the circle as all gold is again becoming a global currency like it used to, but this time a new, digital gold.</p>

<p class="">One way to assess the value of Bitcoin under this framework is to estimate how much of gold’s value will be transferred to Bitcoin in the coming decades. The total value of all gold that have been mined is in the order of $10 trillion. We know there will not be more than 21 million bitcoin minted (less, since a portion of all bitcoin has been lost). Thus if Bitcoin captures 20% of gold’s value, the value per bitcoin would be roughly $100,000.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Work Tokens</strong></p>
<p class="">Sometimes I’ve referred to Work Tokens as Blockchain Native Security Tokens. I don’t mean that they are securities from a legal standpoint, but they do exhibit some traits founds in Equities and Bonds, namely some kind of cash flow is involved. Note that I’m using cash flow generously here, in some cases crypto is distributed, in other cases there is a burn or you risk losing crypto if you don’t participate in a certain activity. Work Tokens is a good name as the payment is made in exchange for work. The kind of work the tokens encourage varies a lot:</p>
<p class=""><em>Securing the blockchain</em></p>
<p class="">Bitcoin miners are paid newly minted bitcoin and transaction fees for securing the ledger. For them Bitcoin is a Work Token.</p>
<p class=""><em>Validating blocks</em></p>
<p class="">In proof-of-stake systems new coin inflation is paid to the validators as a reward. By locking up coins, the validators risks being slashed in exchange for a possible reward.</p>
<p class=""><em>Governance</em></p>
<p class="">Some projects such as 0X (in the case of 0X no cash flow per se is going to the token holders, its token economics is currently in flux) and MakerDAO have a token for coordinating decentralised governance.</p>
<p class=""><em>Reporting outcomes</em></p>
<p class="">Augur is a predicting market where holders of the REP token can participate in reporting market outcomes. In V2 of Augur as a token holder you risk being slashed if you don’t participate during certain market related circumstances.</p>
<p class=""><em>Predicting outcomes</em></p>
<p class="">Erasure is building a protocol where the token NMR is used as a stake in relation to ones confidence about your prediction.</p>
<p class="">The above is just some examples of possible work that Work Tokens can encourage, this is still an area of much innovation.</p>
<p class="">Note that just because there is a crypto-related ‘cash flow’ doesn’t mean the asset has a yield in the traditional sense. Ethereum moving to Proof-of-Stake doesn’t mean that Ethereum becomes a yield paying asset. The reason for this is that the reward is paid in the same currency as the token. It is a bit like a stock doing a stock split, it doesn’t make it more valuable. It does mean however that if you don’t participate in validating blocks, you’re leaving money on the table. The value comes from having a demand side and a supply side that work in sync. Take the case with the MakerDAO network. MakerDAO is a protocol for lending on top of Ethereum. There is a demand for Maker tokens from borrowers as they need to pay interest with the Maker token. Maker tokens that are used are burnt in the process. Thus it is relatively straightforward, at least in theory, to calculate a net present value of Maker using a discounted cash flow model.</p>
<p class="">Work tokens are often built on top of blockchains such as Ethereum and thus classified as Middleware assets. As such they can be blockchain agnostic and potentially capture value across blockchains. Decentralised work tokens is quickly emerging as one of the most exciting places for crypto investors to place capital and participate in the network.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Utility Tokens</strong></p>
<p class="">Utility tokens are also known as Payment Tokens, they focus on the medium of exchange use case of crypto assets. Sometimes they are restricted to a certain payment or a product or service within a network, other times they try to be a general payment token. One of the most clear types of utility tokens are stablecoins. They are typically pegged to a national currency like the USD or the AUD.</p>
<p class="">For utility tokens we have a valuation framework in the Equation of Exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">MV=PQ</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">Here M is the monetary base, V is the velocity, P is the price and Q is the quantity.</p>
<p class="">Bitcoin’s use case for remittances is an example of it being used as a utility. Say $1bn is sent through a particular remittances payment corridor per year. In our case P times Q equals 1bn. Assuming a velocity of 5, the monetary base needs to be 1bn/5 = $200M. This hypotethical example would be additive to any other use case for Bitcoin.</p>
<p class="">As we have seen with Bitcoin, a crypto asset can span two or three of the categories above.</p>
<p class="">In summary we are getting a clearer picture as how to look at crypto assets from a valuation standpoint. This is a fascinating subject that is evolving rapidly and that I’m sure we will come back to many times in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">Our edge at Apollo Capital is our experience in both traditional financial markets and crypto markets. On a daily basis, Henrik and I draw upon our experience from traditional markets to construct a portfolio of crypto assets. Combined with our knowledge of crypto assets, we are the best in the country, if not further afield, at managing a crypto portfolio.</p>
<p class="">While I don’t pretend to know as much about crypto or financial markets as Henrik, my experience* is different and has undoubtedly shaped the way I approach crypto funds management.  I thought it timely to share a few thoughts on investing in crypto, in particular volatility, opportunity &amp; position sizing.</p>
<p class="">(*for more information on my background, please feel free to visit <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-johnston-au/">my LinkedIn page.</a>)</p>
<h2>1. Volatility</h2>
<p class="">A number of traditional financial ratios and models use volatility as a measure of risk. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), developed by Harry Markowitz in 1952, is used to optimise portfolios based on their expected returns and observed risk. The standard deviation of an asset’s returns is used as standardised measure of risk. MPT, CAPM, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratios, nearly every ratio I have come across uses volatility as a unit of risk.</p>
<p class="">The general theory is that the more volatile the asset, the higher the standard deviation of returns, the riskier the asset. <strong>The words volatile and risky have almost become interchangeable </strong>in financial markets.</p>
<p class="">If we put crypto through these models, I suspect the models would spontaneously combust. Crypto is extremely volatile. I usually check crypto prices a couple of times a day and it is common to see 24hr price swings of greater than 10%. Imagine if that were the case in equity markets! Throughout the 16 months since inception, the Apollo Capital Fund has already delivered monthly returns ranging from +45% to -34%.</p>
<p class="">In Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s 2007 annual meeting, <strong>Warren Buffett said the following about volatility and risk</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">“It&#8217;s nice, it&#8217;s mathematical, and wrong. Volatility is not risk. Those who have written about risk don&#8217;t know how to measure risk. Past volatility does not measure risk. When farm prices crashed, [farm price] volatility went up, but a farm priced at $600 per acre that was formerly $2,000 per acre isn&#8217;t riskier because it&#8217;s more volatile.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">Instead, Buffett prefers the dictionary definition of risk: “risk is the possibility of loss or injury.”</p>
<p class="">Why is crypto risky?</p>
<p class="">It is clear that investing in crypto is risky: there is a possibility of loss (hopefully not injury!) and that <strong>possibility exists because crypto is young and the future is uncertain</strong>. Any groundbreaking technology is going to be met by opposing camps of skepticism and fervour. Crypto is a complex topic and it’s future is anything but clear. It is easy to forget, but many people thought the same about internet stocks in the mid 90s &#8211; they were risky investments.</p>
<p class="">Why is crypto volatile?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Crypto is volatile for two reasons</strong>: it is risky and prices are retail driven.</p>
<p class="">Crypto prices are predominantly retail driven. Retail investors are more easily caught up in the waves of greed and fear that drive financial markets, especially crypto markets. While the equities that represented the internet hysteria were certainly volatile, they were not as retail driven as crypto markets. Crypto assets are more accessible to the world’s population than equities on listed stock exchanges and equity markets are largely driven by institutional capital.</p>
<p class="">The distinction between risk and volatility is important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">“Crypto is not risky because it is volatile. Crypto is volatile because it is risky”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">Once we accept this important distinction, <strong>the solution to deal with the risk is clear: position sizing</strong>.</p>
<p class="">Position sizing refers to allocation of capital to a particular investment in the context of the overall portfolio. For us as managers of the Fund, we discuss the size of positions such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Do we invest 10%, 20% or 40% of the portfolio in Bitcoin? For the individual investor, position sizing refers to the amount of capital allocated to crypto relative to the overall portfolio.</p>
<p class="">Although we do not provide advice to investors in the Fund, we certainly do not advocate investing 50% of a portfolio in crypto, it’s too risky. The possibility of loss is too great and the consequences of any loss too severe. Many of the greatest thinkers in crypto suggest allocating an amount of capital that the investor is prepared to lose. Studies of institutional investors in crypto suggest starting allocations of 0.2% to 0.3%. Crypto is risky and for any investment in crypto there is a possibility of loss of capital.</p>
<h2>2. Opportunity</h2>
<p class="">I used to work at a funds management company that managed more than $500m of client funds in Australian equities. My former boss, a veteran investor with more than 30 years experience across a range of markets, taught me a number of lessons about investing. One of the key lessons that stuck with me is “<strong>the best returns often come from the ones you feel uneasy about.</strong>” I didn’t realise it at the time, but I now understand why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">“Risk creates opportunity”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">When a company’s future is uncertain, when the risk feels high, other investors often reach similar conclusions, many choosing to avoid that risk by either selling or not investing. Risk can create opportunities to buy assets that are cheap. It is the job of the investor to discern from risky opportunities that are worth investing in, compared to those that are doomed to fail.</p>
<p class="">I see similar circumstances to crypto assets. There are numerous reasons why crypto assets may not succeed. Investing in crypto is risky. This creates opportunity. One of the main reasons for this uncertainty is a lack of understanding. The vast majority of people have not or will not spend a little time trying to understand crypto. This is a missed opportunity to learn about a technology with enormous disruptive and innovative potential.</p>
<p class=""><strong>This creates opportunity for those that have a keener understanding of crypto</strong>. It is interesting at this point to stop and consider, “how much do I need to understand to make an investment in crypto?” An investor doesn’t need a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies of crypto assets to make an investment. Just as we don’t need to understand the code behind Google’s search algorithms, we don’t need to understand the of code that powers the Bitcoin network. A more relevant understanding is the power of Google’s search algorithms to its users, the power of the Bitcoin network to its users and why both are better than the alternatives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">“Investors need to understand the three forces driving crypto innovation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">First, it is a groundbreaking technology. We have written at length how crypto removes the need for trusted intermediaries and the resulting waves of disruptive innovation. Second, it has attracted huge amounts of capital. Third, the world’s best computer software engineers are flocking to work on challenging crypto projects. Understanding the power of innovation that is likely to come from these forces is more important than knowing the details of the Ethereum code.</p>
<p class="">For those that see the potential, for those that read Apollo Capital’s weekly newsletter and understand why crypto shows promise, investing a small amount in crypto is obvious. Investors realise the inherent risks in these investments, but they accept these risks and in doing so, give themselves a chance of capturing the upside.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Again, we come back to position sizing.</strong> The future of crypto is uncertain and accordingly, it makes most sense to only invest a small percentage of the portfolio in crypto assets. Despite working in crypto and understanding crypto assets better than most, I only have a small percentage of my net worth in crypto. I have a far, far greater percentage in my house, despite having greater conviction in crypto than the property market in Australia.</p>
<p class="">&#8212;</p>
<p class="">An unfounded fear of volatility and a lack of understanding is causing the majority of investors to miss out on the crypto opportunity. Many are waiting to understand crypto in full, or for there to be greater understanding from their peers and the media. They are missing the point. By the time this happens, the market capitalisation of crypto assets will be in the trillions.</p>
<p class="">Once crypto becomes mainstream and well understood, the opportunity will be long gone, leaving many investors to regret the omission of a small allocation in their portfolio.</p>
<p class="">**please note this article does not constitute financial advice. My thoughts are my own.</p>

<p>Investing in crypto-assets before 2017 was a very niche activity, largely limited to technologists, libertarians, and some speculative investors. This is changing. Goldman Sachs, perhaps the most storied name in finance, has confirmed their intention to trade bitcoin. Closer to home, the ASX announced that by 2020, they will switch to a blockchain-based distributed ledger that will clear and settle the $2 trillion Australian equity market.</p>
<p>Crypto assets are tokens that are needed to run decentralised blockchains. Blockchains are fundamentally a new way of organising our society based on decentralisation. Instead of having big corporations, like Facebook and Google, owning our digital data, blockchain technology enables individuals to take ownership of digital goods directly. Bitcoin was the first crypto asset, the first asset that enabled outright digital ownership. The Bitcoin blockchain is used to transfer value over the internet while disintermediating financial institutions. Today, blockchains are being built not just around money, but other private data, like identity, medical records, supply chains, and much more. Blockchains also have the ability to support a new kind of decentralised application; Ethereum is an example of a blockchain enabling that. Blockchains have three core characteristics that set them apart from other digital assets: they are censorship resistant (built on open source code), trustless (we don&#8217;t have to trust a third party) and their are permissionless (anyone can join these open networks).</p>
<p>While crypto-assets are now started being accepted by an increasing part of the investment community, the asset class remains nascent and extremely volatile. Even if the proportion of individuals and institutions with investments in crypto-assets increase, crypto is likely to remain a minority of their overall portfolio in the short to medium term. There’s therefore a pressing need to understand how these assets perform when placed <em>within</em> a diversified portfolio of traditional assets, and not just as an independent asset-class. This article attempts to shed light on some of these dynamics.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, the oldest and most famous crypto-asset, is studied here as a proxy to the broader market. Our analysis uncovers that bitcoin is a very compelling alternative investment given its high potential for capital growth, low correlation to traditional assets (diversification benefits) and highly liquid nature.</p>
<p><strong>Capital Growth &amp; Volatility</strong></p>
<p>From a capital growth perspective, bitcoin has performed extraordinarily well: US$1000 invested in bitcoin on May 3 2013 would now (May 3 2018) be worth ~US$104,000.</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s extraordinary growth trajectory, however, has not been linear. Relative to other assets such as stocks, bonds or commodities, bitcoin’s standard deviation of returns (‘volatility’) has been materially higher.

<p>Crypto’s extreme volatility is driven by numerous factors. Crypto remains relatively unregulated and speculative. It has also been driven by retail investors. A retail investment market, with little institutional or regulatory input, is likely to be more volatile than one where institutional money has a stake. We are now seeing institutional money enter the market, and with it more market confidence and certainty. Regulatory bodies around the world are rapidly adjusting to the crypto paradigm. For example, the USA’s SEC recently deemed that Ethereum is not a security, and in February Switzerland’s Financial Regulator, FINMA, released their ICO guidelines.</p>
<p>The emergent crypto-asset valuation techniques are also a likely cause for volatility. A widely accepted behavioural finance paper by Barker and Wurgler (2006) argues that market-wide sentiment should exert stronger impacts on stocks that are difficult to value. The broader issue here is that crypto-assets are digital and new, meaning their fundamental value is harder to comprehend. We may expect a decrease in volatility as crypto markets mature, and investors gain deeper knowledge and conviction about valuation techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Correlation with Traditional Assets &amp; Diversification Benefits</strong><br />
Alternative investments are frequently used for diversification and hedging reasons. The below table is a summary of bitcoin’s correlations with more traditional assets, namely the S&amp;P 500, Global Equities, and US Bonds. Gold is also included as a comparative alternative investment. The data is based on weekly returns from July 2016 to September 2017. Both gold and bitcoin experienced low correlations to other assets during this period (see table below). Bitcoin correlated even less than gold to most asset classes, especially when compared to US Bonds.</p>

<p>We’ve seen that Bitcoin is independently highly volatile, but interestingly when added to a this diversified portfolio it actually <em>decreased </em>overall<em> </em>volatility, while increasing overall returns. This was due to the non-correlative nature of the asset and its high historical capital growth.</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity of Bitcoin</strong></p>
<p>Alternative investments typically demonstrate lower liquidity when compared to more traditional assets such as stocks or bonds. For example, it is more difficult to find a buyer for a $100,000 bottle of wine than, say, the equivalent amount in Apple stock. This is not true of crypto-assets. In fact, crypto-assets are traded on exchanges that are accessible anywhere in the world (with an internet connection and/or a VPN) and are open 24/7. Today’s (June 25 2018) 24 hour volume of bitcoin was more than US$4.5 billion; over the same period, volume for the crypto-asset market was almost US$17 billion. There are certainly threats to bitcoin and crypto-asset liquidly, such as exchange closure, hostile regulation, and acceptance, but these do not seem to be affecting the markets currently.</p>
<p><strong>Crypto as an asset class</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin is only one of over 1500 crypto-assets, each of which have different characteristics and uses. For simplicity, we have limited analysis to bitcoin. However, it is critical to think of crypto as more than bitcoin: the applications of these assets go far beyond the vertical of money. The universe of crypto is expanding and the diversity of assets will require further studies into their performance as part of a diversified portfolio. The dynamics of non-correlation and diversification have been shown exist when the alternative investment is extended to a diversified portfolio of crypto-assets. Academics David Lee, Li Guo, and Yu Wang writing in the Journal of Alternative Investments in 2018, concluded that concluded that</p>
<p><em>‘…cryptocurrencies can be a good option to help diversify portfolio risks because the correlations between cryptocurrencies and traditional assets are consistently low and the average daily return of most cryptocurrencies is higher than that of traditional investments’.</em></p>
<p>Apollo Capital believes firmly that a diversified and actively managed portfolio of high potential crypto assets is the best way to achieve diversification and non-correlative results over the long run. We will soon publish another piece on this subject with recent data.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Crypto-assets present a compelling alternative investment opportunity, but it is clearly not the faint hearted. Bitcoin’s extreme high volatility may indicate that placing all one’s wealth in it may be foolish. However, including an amount in a diversified portfolio of traditional assets has been shown to increase returns and lower overall volatility, while the alternative investment remains very liquid. Time will tell if these relationships hold. But with institutional money about to enter the space, and mass market psychology close to a nadir, this might be the moment to take a closer look.</p>
