										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto asset market is experiencing the most turbulent times in the market’s history. Various large centralised institutions are becoming insolvent, with each week passing more news comes to light of trouble market players. In this article, we will outline how these centralised entities have harmed the market through excessive risk-taking behaviour performed in a non-transparent fashion. We will then look at how transparent DeFi protocols have performed throughout these volatile times providing examples with crypto assets held by Apollo Capital, showcasing their consistent market demand through generating consistent cash flows for liquidity providers and token holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Centralised Finance (CeFi) Troubles</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celsius is a CeFi platform that offered investors lucrative interest rates on their crypto assets held on the platform. The business was founded in 2017 and enjoyed explosive growth in the years that followed due to their widespread marketing and general ease of use for retail investors.</span><a href="https://celsius.network/about-us"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">According to their website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Celsius was managing US$11.82 billion in assets (17 May 2022) and had processed US$8.2 billion in loans, making them an important crypto market participant for many years.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1512 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--1024x753.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="552" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--1024x753.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--300x221.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius--768x565.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Celsius-.jpg 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Celsius&#8217;s Announcement to their Users on the 12th of June 2022</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On 12 June 2022, Celsius announced that it was suspending “all withdrawals, swaps and transfers between accounts”. The freezing of customers&#8217; assets caught many users off guard, as they viewed Celsius as a reliable and safe way to store their crypto assets as advertised on their social media, website and via referral partners. Also portrayed in their messaging were their safe and reliable yield generating practices which lead users to believed Celsius generated the yield for their customers through direct crypto lending and conservative DeFi practices. In reality, they were undertaking riskier business practices to earn this yield, with no transparency on their procedures and strategies. Some mainstream media outlets have previously labelled Celsius as a DeFi platform along with the various referral partners on social media. However, this was simply not the case &#8211; as DeFi protocols provide complete transparency and on-chain verification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Celsius platform, user deposits are treated as a liability on the balance sheet, similar to a bank. The platform’s underlying profitability depends on its ability to take these deposits and earn a higher yield than they are required to pay depositors. With insufficient demand from the market for direct crypto loans, CeFi platforms allocate their assets into DeFi protocols and staking to meet their yield targets. The key events that led to the insolvency of Celsius included losing 38,000 ETH to the platform ‘Stakehound’, losing US$54 million in the Badger DAO hack, general liquidity requirements mismanagement and large user withdrawals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the full extent of the Celsius collapse is yet to be realised, it is the everyday user who suffers due to the risk-taking behaviour of a centralised entity. While hacks in DeFi can also be devastating for retail users, CeFi platforms have long engaged in marketing tactics that entice less sophisticated investors to utilise their products and carry the risk. </span></p>
<p><b>Risky Lending Practices &#8211; Three Arrows Capital (3AC)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before its insolvency, Three Arrows Capital was a proprietary trading firm that earned a considerable reputation in the crypto market by making concentrated bets and securing enormous profits. They were highly sought after VC style investors in the primary markets and amassed US$10-15 billion in assets throughout the bull market. Their downfall was catalysed by enormous losses from the collapse of LUNA and the following broader market sell off. It is rumoured that 3AC’s debt could amount to around US$1 billion, with the flow on effects likely to have a lasting impact on both retail and institutional investors alike.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder of Three Arrows Capital, Zhu Su broke his Twitter silence with this tweet on the 15th of June.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1521 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--1024x516.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="378" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--1024x516.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--300x151.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su--768x387.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zhu-Su-.jpg 1166w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3AC used their reputation to gain under-collateralised credit lines from risk seeking centralised lenders who were fiercely competing with each other, leading to irresponsible lending practices. It is reasonable to assume that many of these lenders would not have had a clear view into the balance sheet of 3AC. Whether that was through ignorance, fraud or a mixture of both, is up for speculation. The transparency offered by decentralised finance poses a stark contrast to these centralised entities. Smart contract enabled financial applications do not distinguish between users’ reputations,  they are transparent pieces of code that simply keep functioning, day after day. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MakerDAO &amp; DAI</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MakerDAO is a great example of stability in the DeFi ecosystem despite the current market conditions and volatility caused by centralised entities and poorly designed crypto assets. After the Luna / UST collapse, one of our analysts spoke of the importance of MakerDAO and its over collateralised stablecoin DAI in an</span><a href="https://stockhead.com.au/cryptocurrency/apollos-moonshots-strength-in-maker-convex-opportunity-and-luna-crash-silver-linings/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">interview with Stockhead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. MakerDAO has demonstrated the importance of decentralisation and thoughtful design in peer-to-peer networks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can ‘mint’ DAI against the crypto asset collateral they choose to deposit into the protocol’s smart contracts. The amount of DAI minted by the user becomes a debt, repaying this debt by ‘burning’ the minted DAI plus interest unlocks this deposited collateral. DAI is pegged to the US dollar and is considered to be the most decentralised over-collateralised stablecoin. The decentralised aspect of DAI is an important reason that MakerDAO has been able to survive these market conditions and continues to flourish. The main reason for DAI’s decentralisation is because the collateral used to mint DAI are primarily the most decentralised crypto assets like ETH and BTC with the only requirement for a user to mint DAI being a crypto wallet, with no KYC needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minimum collateral ratio that users are able to borrow for certain asset types is 130%, meaning if the user wanted to borrow 10,000 DAI, they must collateralise their position with at least $13,000 worth of ETH. Also known as the liquidation ratio, if the collateralised value drops below this number, the borrower will be subject to partial liquidation to cover outstanding debt, this comes with a liquidation fee of 13%. Due to MakerDAO&#8217;s transparency and being able to view all data on the blockchain, investors do not have to worry about misleading and unethical behaviour that stems from centralised entities who have hidden information from users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Stability, Total Value Locked, Revenue, On-Chain Statistics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the recent turmoil and volatility in the crypto markets, the DAI token has proven itself as a truly stable and trustworthy stablecoin. DAI uses what is known as a Peg-Stability Module (PSM) to ensure it has a 1:1 valuation with the US Dollar. The Peg Stability Module allows users to swap a given collateral type directly for DAI at a fixed rate, rather than borrowing DAI. The PSM contract allows users to swap other stablecoins such as USDC for DAI, making DAI’s peg very stable as any variation in the price can be arbitraged. The transparency and stability achieved through the implementation and reiteration of the protocol’s design over several years is a testament to the ultimate goal of Decentralised Finance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are able to look at other stablecoins such as UST and USDT when comparing the stability of DAI’s peg. However, DAI is the only decentralised stablecoin backed by on-chain crypto, which strengthens the support of its peg. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MakerDAO is currently trading at $1020 with a market cap of $1 billion and total value locked (TVL) of approximately $7.9 billion, which accounts for over 10% of the TVL in the entire DeFi space. The amount of BTC locked in the protocol is at an all time high with approximately 68,000 BTC locked (wrapped BTC on the Ethereum blockchain). With market conditions forcing some centralised companies into insolvency, MakerDAO has generated an annual total revenue of $34.9 million, and is one of the highest grossing DeFi protocols.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Aave</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aave is a highly renowned DeFi money market where users can supply and borrow crypto assets at an interest rate determined by the supply and demand of funds in the protocol. Aave is another major DeFi protocol that has survived the test of time while centralised lenders have caused disruption and uncertainty in the market. Aave is available across many layer one ecosystems such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Artbitrum, Harmony and layer twos such as Arbitrum and Optimism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the over-collateralisation mechanics of the Aave lending market as well as the community’s careful approach to only enabling highly decentralised and ‘safe’ crypto assets, there has never been a default case or ‘bad debt’ on the platform. The trust and stability of Aave are evident through its growth in user volume to $9.74 billion of liquidity locked across 7 networks and over 13 markets. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1522 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--1024x558.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="409" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--1024x558.jpeg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--300x163.jpeg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms--768x418.jpeg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AAVE-Multiple-Platforms-.jpeg 1484w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Aave &#8211; TVL, Revenue, On-Chain statistics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aave has implemented many risk parameters to ensure the stability of the protocol. When market conditions change, risks change. Specific parameters include the loan to value and liquidation thresholds related to the risk of each of the assets available in the Aave protocol. A liquidation in Aave occurs when a borrower&#8217;s collateral value is not properly covering their loan/debt value, thus the user&#8217;s health factor falls below 1. To prevent these types of liquidations, Aave users are able to over-collateralise so that they can cover their debt and reduce the risk of their assets falling below their liquidation level. This has limited the number of liquidations that have occurred on the protocol and has encouraged more users to safely borrow on the protocol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the number of liquidations that have occurred on Aave’s protocol has totalled $24.2m. This number is very small compared to the total liquidation value this year of over $2 billion. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lending Market Liquidations</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1524" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="774" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI.jpg 1290w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DeFi-Lending-Platform-Charts_-Aave-Compound-and-DAI-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1290px) 100vw, 1290px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAVE is currently trading at $66.30 and has a market cap of around $920m with a Total Value Locked of approximately $6.75 billion, the second highest TVL out of any protocol in the DeFi sector. The lending protocol also has an annualised total revenue of $68.6m, which the majority is distributed to the lenders on the protocol who earn interest on the capital they lend. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Uniswap</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap is the leading decentralised exchange (DEX) in DeFi. Unlike centralised exchanges and entities, Uniswaps transactions are all stored in the blockchain and are available for everyone to see &#8211; displaying their transparency and trust with its community. Using smart contract interactions, the protocol facilitates automated transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol supports thousands of digital assets and stable coins across the Ethereum ecosystem and is crucial for the stability of the DeFi sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap recently surpassed $1 trillion in lifetime transaction volume, more than any other decentralised exchange. Uniswap liquidity providers earn a percentage of the transaction fees which incentivises them to provide liquidity &#8211; which is an example of the community engagement that is supported by decentralised entities. Despite the recent downdraws in the global markets, the transaction volume on Uniswap continues to rise and many new users are interacting with the protocol. </span></p>
<p><b>Uniswap &#8211; TVL, Revenue, On-Chains statistics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap reached an all time high valuation of $45 in May of 2021. It is currently trading at $5.68 and has a fully diluted market cap of around $5.14 billion. The TVL in Uniswap is approximately $5 billion , making it the 4th largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL. Uniswaps exchange has generated an annualised total revenue of $750 million, making it the highest grossing DeFi protocol, with most of the revenue distributed to liquidity providers. The total revenue generated by the exchange is up 65.3% for the year, which illustrates the protocol&#8217;s stability and importance compared to many other centralised exchanges.</span></p>

<p><b>Monthly DeFi revenue</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global financial markets continue to shake the digital asset class and challenge the stability of the decentralised financial sector. However top protocols such as MakerDao, AAVE and Uniswap have proven that they can be successful and perform well despite the turmoil caused and exhibited by centralised entities. These are just a few of the top decentralised applications that continue to generate positive cash flows in a transparent manner for token holders and users. </span></p>

<p class="">A wave of skepticism and scrutiny has followed Libra’s announcement in June this year. Almost everyone has jumped on board the ‘bash Facebook’ train.</p>
<p class="">Last week Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the House Financial Services Committee for a six-hour hearing on Libra.</p>
<p class="">Surprisingly, indirect help for Libra’s project came a few days after the hearing, from the most unlikely of sources.</p>
<p class="">__</p>
<p class="">Libra initially announced with 28 founding member organisations that would form the initial Libra Association. The plan was to start with 28 initial member organisations and grow to 100, with no one organisation in control.</p>
<p class="">The reasons were clear for launching Libra as a consortium rather than one company such as Facebook. A highly valued characteristic of crypto assets is a certain threshold of decentralisation. At Apollo Capital, we carefully analyse the level to which a crypto asset is decentralised, seeing greater risk in assets that are too centralised. Unlike fiat currencies which can be debased by central banks or censored by oppressive States, valuable crypto assets typically cannot be controlled by one central actor. Libra’s goal to grow to 100 members is an attempt to demonstrate that it is sufficiently decentralised. Libra is not Facebook’s project, Facebook is merely one member.</p>
<p class="">Two weeks ago the Libra Association formed with 21 member organisations. 7 dropped out since the initial announcement. A number of commentators have used this to suggest that the project is on shaky grounds. Our view is that a number of members decided to drop out because of the backlash against Facebook and the project. A few companies including Visa, Mastercard and Stripe received letters from Senators asking them to rethink their involvement in Libra. If they didn’t, their existing business would come under intense scrutiny from regulators.</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">Last week, the spotlight on Libra and Facebook intensified as Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the House Financial Services Committee. Before we analyse the questions and answers, let’s stop and ask why Zuckerberg, if Facebook is only one member of the Libra Association? The answer to this is three-fold. First, it appears that Facebook has led the Libra charge. Initial job posts were made by Facebook as long as one year ago. Second, if politicians were looking to beat up the Libra project, Zuckerberg makes the perfect scapegoat. Third, Facebook have plans to develop Calibra, a wallet that can be used to send and store Libra tokens.</p>
<p class="">What did we learn from Zuck’s appearance?</p>
<p class="">While it was an ideal opportunity to learn more about Libra, unfortunately the episode was largely political. A number of members of Congress used the opportunity to grandstand and showboat, probing Zuckerberg about the Cambridge Analytica scandal and all the problems facing Facebook. One even asked Zuckerberg if vaccines were 100% safe and accused his platform of burying content from anti-vaxxers.</p>
<p class="">In amongst the rubble of political showmanship, there were some interesting insights into the concerns of politicians, as well as responses from Zuckerberg.</p>
<p class="">One such concern was the <strong>potential threat from Libra to the US Dollar. </strong></p>
<p class="">“The dollar is very important to us as a tool, a tool of American power and also a tool of American values. We would much prefer to put sanctions on a country than send our soldiers there….When something threatens the dollar, we get very nervous”</p>
<p class="">Of course the power of the US Dollar isn’t just limited to a tool of influence, there are also financial concerns at losing the “money [that] pours into the US because of this.”</p>
<p class="">Republican Brad Sherman was perhaps Zuckerberg’s sharpest critic, comparing the functionality of Libra to the functionality of the US Dollar: “<strong>You’re trying to help those for whom the dollar is not a good currency: drug dealers, terrorists, tax evaders</strong>.” Referencing Libra’s initial aims of helping the unbanked, which admittedly Zuckerberg did less this time around, Congressman Sherman was on the front foot:: “the richest man in the world to come here and hide behind the poorest people in the world”</p>
<p class="">Republican Maxine Waters pointed out that Facebook initially banned crypto ads because they are “frequently associated with misleading and deceptive practices.” Facebook then reversed their decision, bought a blockchain company and announced Libra. “Tell us what changed. How did crypto currency go from misleading and deceptive last year, to become a means for financial inclusion this year. You change your policy when it benefits you.”</p>
<p class="">Not all committee members were negative. Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota lent this support to the project, calling his colleagues’ ominous tone disappointing and expressing support for financial innovation.</p>
<p class="">How did Zuckerberg respond?</p>
<p class="">First, he admitted that Facebook isn’t the ideal messenger right now.</p>
<p class="">In response to the questions about the threat to the US Dollar, he landed a solid rebuke saying “<strong>if America doesn’t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.</strong>”</p>
<p class="">Zuckerberg repeatedly said Libra will not launch until it obtains the necessary approvals from US regulators. A number of committee members suggested he was bluffing, asking which regulators that will include. Zuckerberg deflected. Either he is genuine and there is a risk of Facebook leaving the Libra Association, or he and his lawyers know that there are indeed no significant regulatory hurdles.</p>
<p class="">There were suggestions of a design change to Libra. Initially the Libra coin would be backed by a basket of fiat currencies. We previously heard rumours which were strengthened during the hearing that there is a possibility that Libra might only be backed by USD, there will be a minimum percentage of US Dollar backing or there might be multiple crypto currencies for multiple fiat currencies. Some commentators have suggested that in light of concerns of the threat to the US Dollar, they will be surprised to see the basket of currencies survive.</p>
<p class=""><strong>We remain convinced that Libra will be a boon for crypto assets</strong>. Libra’s user base, their expertise in design and the attention surrounding the project will surely lead to greater crypto exposure and adoption. However, to say Libra faces an uphill battle would be an understatement. The regulatory scrutiny from politicians and regulators in the US and around the world continues to grow. Facebook has been unable to separate its poor image and reputation from the project, especially as it relates to privacy. The project is as much Facebook’s as it is the Libra Association’s, in a clear case of perception being greater than reality.</p>
<p class="">Zuckerberg also played the China card in his remarks, urging regulators to act quickly &#8220;While we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn&#8217;t waiting. China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months,&#8221; he said</p>
<p class="">It was no coincidence that over the weekend, only days after Zuckerberg’s remarks, <strong>Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China said China should seize the opportunity to adopt blockchain</strong>. “We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies.”</p>
<p class="">This adds to reports that a digital renminbi is being developed by the Central bank and is likely to be launched by the end of the year. China’s central bank will distribute the digital renminbi to seven institutions, from where these institutions will begin circulating the token to Chinese people.</p>
<p class="">The potential impact of this on crypto is also enormous, introducing crypto assets to China’s 1.3bn people. Bitcoin and Blockchain searches on Baidu (China’s Google equivalent) jumped significantly over the weekend. Perhaps this will have a greater impact on crypto than Libra.</p>
<p class="">It is unclear how President Trump and US politicians will respond to President Xi Jinping’s comments. Perhaps they will be brushed aside. Or perhaps the US just got the kick up the bum it needed, and the Libra Association just found their greatest cause for support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">Last week we saw the biggest announcement in crypto since the Bitcoin Whitepaper. We are clearly not trying to downplay the enormity of this announcement &#8211; it is huge. A consortium of companies, led by Facebook, introduced the world to Libra &#8211; a cryptocurrency backed by a reserve of fiat currencies and government bonds.</p>
<p class="">As your trusted source on everything crypto, we have cut through the noise to distill the possible implications of the Libra announcement. While the project is not without concerns, we think it will be an enormous boost for crypto assets.</p>
<p class="">Let’s start with some of the positives.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Exposure</strong></p>
<p class="">Slowly but surely, more and more people are coming into crypto. We regularly monitor metrics like transaction count and unique addresses, where increasing numbers suggest more people are using crypto assets. With Libra, this is set to accelerate, rapidly. The Libra Association includes companies like Uber, Stripe, Booking.com, Visa, Spotify and of course Facebook. The number of users connected to these members has been estimated at over 4 billion. In comparison, the number of blockchain wallets worldwide has been estimated at 35 million. Libra will serve as an on-ramp to crypto assets. Users might start with Libra and as they become familiar with wallets and crypto transactions, migrate to other crypto assets. We are not suggesting that every Facebook user will use Libra or migrate to other crypto assets, but when you compare 4 billion to 35 million, there only needs to be a tiny conversion rate to make a colossal impact.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Ambition</strong></p>
<p class="">The Libra Association has enormous ambition. In practical terms, the goal is to send money as simply as we send a message &#8211; instantly and borderless. This will allow users to easily send, receive and store money &#8211; a “simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.” The Whitepaper cites ambition to help the 1.7 billion people in the world that are still unbanked. Financial exclusion breeds poverty, which breeds civil unrest and in extreme cases, terrorism and war. Libra believes that “global, open, instant, and low-cost movement of money will create immense economic opportunity and more commerce across the world.”</p>
<p class="">How is Libra better placed to achieve this than existing crypto assets, including Bitcoin?</p>
<p class="">There are a few reasons why <a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2019/4/16/the-unimportance-of-coffee-and-cake">Bitcoin has been slow to be adopted as a Medium of Exchange</a>. First, it is volatile. Second, user adoption has been slow &#8211; it is hard to use Bitcoin if your friends and network do not use Bitcoin. Lastly, there is a lack of infrastructure that allows users to pay with and merchants to accept crypto payments. Merchants need additional infrastructure to receive Bitcoin payments and to convert receipts into fiat currency. While there are a number of companies trying to solve this problem, they are all middlemen charging middleman rates, up to 3% either to the customer or the merchant. Why pay with crypto if the fees are higher than existing options like Mastercard or Visa?</p>
<p class="">The members of the Libra Association can attract the adoption necessary to build the infrastructure. It is a problem of economies of scale. The Libra Association is raising funds to tackle this infrastructure problem and in our view, will be much more likely to succeed than any existing crypto asset or middleman.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Credibility</strong></p>
<p class="">JP Morgan, Fidelity, Yale, Harvard, New York Stock Exchange, Goldman Sachs and now Facebook, Uber, Mastercard, Visa and Vodafone. These are just some of the names that are now actively involved in crypto assets. The addition of the Libra Association founding members adds more credibility to crypto. This is having a direct effect on investors We are seeing this first hand as we talk to potential investors that take comfort from their involvement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">If you still think crypto is nothing more than magical internet money, it’s time to wake up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""><strong>User Experience</strong></p>
<p class="">The user experience associated with many crypto assets is still poor. Facebook, Uber and eBay all know a thing or two about user experience. They also know that user experience can be the difference in creating and distributing a successful product. Libra will be seamless, beautiful, easy to use. Our grandparents will be able to use, send, store and receive crypto assets as easily as they can receive a text message.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Collaboration with Regulators</strong></p>
<p class="">The Libra Association is actively talking with regulators. As regulators develop a better understanding of crypto assets, we see this as a step forward in the push for widespread crypto regulation.</p>
<p class="">
___</p>
<p class="">While there are a number of positives about Libra, there are a few concerns.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Privacy</strong></p>
<p class="">Facebook and privacy. Two words that by themselves evoke mixed responses. When put together, the response is uniformly negative. Facebook has a terrible track record when it comes to privacy. Facebook already has control of vast amounts of our personal data, allowing it to provide a wonderful service to marketers around the world. It is unclear whether it is using Libra to go after our financial data. The cynicists argue that Libra is an attempt to capture our financial data and use this data to Facebook’s advantage. By combining our personal and financial data, Facebook will make even more money from marketers looking to target their advertising. The optimists focus on Facebook’s global inclusionary mission, described above. The Libra Whitepaper is short on detail. It proclaims it will “evaluate new techniques that enhance privacy in the blockchain while considering concerns of practicality, scalability, and regulatory impact.” We retain a healthy skepticism and put the burden of proof on Libra to convince us that transactions and financial data will remain private.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Centralisation</strong></p>
<p class="">Libra is centralised, not decentralised. Decentralisation is a fundamental property of valuable crypto assets. The most valuable crypto assets are decentralised. While it is an improvement over fiat currency that Libra is not centralised in one actor’s hands, it is not the same as being truly decentralised. Libra will start as a permissioned blockchain and start transferring to a permissionless, decentralised blockchain within five years. We won’t hold our breath.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">When there’s someone in charge, an interested party – a policymaker, a banker, a regulator, a shareholder – can lean on them to make changes.</p>
<p class="">Michael J Casey, CoinDesk</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""><strong>Reserve</strong></p>
<p class="">Libra will be backed by a reserve of fiat currencies and short-term treasury bonds. “The assets behind Libra are the major difference between it and many existing cryptocurrencies that lack such intrinsic value.” While we see it as an improvement that Libra is not backed by one fiat currency, rather a basket, let’s not pretend they have intrinsic value. A major reason for the introduction and development of crypto assets was in retaliation to the devaluing of fiat currencies globally, which still persists today. An appreciation for crypto assets often starts by realising that fiat currencies do not have any intrinsic value. The claim that the Libra has intrinsic value is nothing more than marketing spiel.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Marketing Speak</strong></p>
<p class="">In addition to the intrinsic value claim mentioned above, there is clearly a degree of marketing freedom within the Libra Whitepaper. Another example is the promise of pseudonymous transactions and anti-money laundering compliance. These are intrinsically opposed. The Libra Association is trying to appease regulators who require AML compliance and crypto purists who value privacy. The presence of marketing speak, like these examples, makes us question the veracity of other claims in the paper.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>The Lord of the Coins </strong></p>
<p class="">Will this be the “One Coin to Rule them All?”</p>
<p class="">A potential negative is Libra could squash a wide range of other crypto assets. Will Bitcoin lose its appeal as users take a preference to Libra?</p>
<p class="">We have previously discussed how we divide crypto assets into key verticals &#8211; money, privacy, smart contracts, decentralised finance, Web 3.0. It is impossible to optimise crypto, including Libra, across all of these verticals.</p>
<p class="">Libra poses the greatest threat to the money vertical, specifically as a Medium of Exchange and stablecoins. We do not think Bitcoin will be challenged as “digital gold,” a decentralised, censorship resistant, deflationary, store of value. We do think the Medium of Exchange crypto assets (eg: Litecoin, Bitcoin SV) will be challenged. We think users will prefer Libra over alternatives as it is likely to be accepted more widely and easier to use. Libra will also challenge stablecoins. Tether, USDC, Pax Coin, Gemini, DAI all stand to be tested as Libra enters the market as an alternative stablecoin.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">__</p>
<p class="">From a humble whitepaper released to a small mailing list in 2008, to one of the largest technology companies in the world releasing its own version, it is clear crypto assets have come a long way in the last ten years.</p>
<p class="">We at Apollo Capital are very excited to see the developments over the next ten years.</p>

<p>Stablecoins are an <strong>incredibly exciting </strong>area of crypto. We are seeing a lot of innovation happening in this area.</p>
<p>Stablecoins are crypto assets pegged to the price of another (stable) asset like US Dollar (USD) or Gold.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Stablecoins are a primitive, a critical building block for mass crypto adoption.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, we have seen Circle and Coinbase, Paxos, and Gemini launch regulated stablecoins in the United States. Earlier this year, the algorithmic stablecoin <em>Basis </em>received over US$130 in funding from Bain Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Stanley Druckenmiller, among others. A few weeks ago, Andreessen Horowitz made a US$10 million investment in MakerDAO.</p>

<p>In today’s marketplace, one thing is certain: not all stablecoins are created equal. People are still attempting to create an optimal stablecoin.</p>

<li><strong>Fiat backed stablecoins: </strong>These are stablecoins backed by fiat in a bank account or escrow account. By far the most successful model so far. Apollo Capital invested in TrustToken, which is backing trueUSD.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto backed stablecoins: </strong>These tokens are backed by a volatile asset such as Ethereum. The most popular one includes dai/MakerDAO. Apollo Capital is a holder of the Maker token. Others include Australian project Havven and South Korean Terra.money.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithmic stablecoins</strong>. These use a form of seignorage shares where supply is adjusted to make sure a peg is not broken. Two projects in this category are Basis and Fragments.</li>
</ol>
<p>We think there are a number of factors that should be optimised over to create a successful and sustainable stablecoin, not just stability. <strong>At least as important are decentralisation, scalability and liquidity.</strong></p>
<p>Generally, fiat backed stablecoins rate very poorly on decentralisation as they are backed by money in a financial institution controlled by a single entity.</p>
<p>It is our view that decentralisation is essential for creating an open financial system. A decentralised stablecoin is <strong>permissionless </strong>(open to anyone), <strong>censorship resistant </strong>(transaction finality can be guaranteed) and <strong>trustless</strong>(we don’t have to trust our funds with a third party).</p>

<p>The holy grail would be a <strong>decentralised, fully backed stablecoin.</strong></p>
<p>Here are some of the reasons we are excited about the stablecoin ecosystem:</p>
<p>&#8211; If we can create a relatively stable crypto asset, <strong>we can increase the crypto ecosystem massively</strong>. Many of economic functions that traditional fiat currencies serve, would be able to migrate.</p>
<p>&#8211; We could do <strong>merchant payments </strong>in crypto without the need to convert back to fiat; we can <strong>lend, borrow</strong>, and <strong>pay salaries </strong>using a stablecoin.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Remittances </strong>could be made on the rails of Ethereum, meaning they are fast, cost little, and settle almost instantly.</p>
<p>&#8211; We see stablecoins is a <strong>basic primitive for smart contracts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Derivatives </strong>are low hanging fruit for smart contract technology with an integrated stablecoin</p>
<p>&#8211; I<strong>COs and STOs</strong>, our new methods of fundraising, will likely be financed using stablecoins.</p>
<p>&#8211; Stablecoins are mainly used today as a <strong>hedge for traders and investors</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8211; If we have trusted stablecoins, <strong>traders may not feel the need to sell back to fiat </strong>(and the much slower banking system) during a market correction — and instead stay in the crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8211; As a side effect, as when crypto exchanges create more stablecoins pairs, we will likely see <strong>more of a differentiated return profile between crypto assets.</strong></p>
<p>Much work needs to be done to create an optimal stablecoin, but the race is on.</p>
<p>We are seeing an explosion of stablecoins; some that are pegged to the US Dollar (USD), and others to fiat currencies like Australian Dollar (AUD), Japanese Yen (JPY); some to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and others to Gold. In fact, I’ve been helping Melbourne Mint launch a Gold back stablecoin called Meld (<a href="http://meld.gold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meld.gold</a>).</p>
<p>The crypto market is yet again reinventing itself. However, on the eve of the 10 year anniversary of <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Satoshi’s white paper</a>, let’s recognise the long-term promise of Bitcoin as not only a store of value but a stable medium of exchange — the ultimate stablecoin.</p>
