										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent correction in financial asset valuation had been a reckoning many global macro focused investors warned about for years.  The long-feared QT and interest rate normalisation have impacted liquidity and a re-rating of financial assets.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, central bank action has been limited relative to market expectations.  However, sticky inflation numbers and central bank recognition of their slow response have increased expectations for sizeable action over coming periods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first signal of a changing of the guard began in February 2021, as long-term interest rates began to rise.  That month, the US 10-year rate increased from 1.17% to 1.67%.  The technology darlings, often without any positive earnings, were in the firing line. For example, ARKK fell 34% by May 2021 and by June 14, 2022, it had dropped 76% from its Feb 2021 high.  Understandably, long duration equities are expected to deliver a higher proportion of future cash flows in the distant future and can be expected to suffer in a rising rate environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More generally, as interest rates have increased since January 2022 (US 10-year yield from 1.68% to 3.48%) the SP 500 has fallen over -22.1% from all time highs, and US government bonds (TLT -20 year) have lost -24.3% YTD (both in US$).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto and digital assets, also considered a disruptive technology, have suffered in this environment.  As of 20 June 2022, BTC/USD has fallen 70.1% from its 2021 peak, and the Crypto10 index (Top 10 crypto assets by market cap) has fallen 81.5% from its November 2021 highs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many headlines promote the demise of innovative technology and crypto with their price falls, the long-term participants in small cap technology and crypto environments have experienced frequent falls of significant magnitude in the past.  The table below highlights the volatility and price swing potential in BTC/USD. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understandably, the volatility and risk of capital loss would dictate sizing within a portfolio to be relatively small. For example, a typical allocation may be .50% to 3.0% of a total portfolio, with crypto enthusiasts holding a higher level.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure 1  BTC/USD Historical Worst Drawdowns</span></i></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1489" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BTC-Drawdowns-1.jpg" alt="" width="1263" height="982" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BTC-Drawdowns-1.jpg 1263w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BTC-Drawdowns-1-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BTC-Drawdowns-1-1024x796.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BTC-Drawdowns-1-768x597.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1263px) 100vw, 1263px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Asset Allocation and Re-Balancing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our view, overall portfolio asset allocation should be constructed for all economic environments. This macro winter&#8217;s fall in bonds and equities highlights the flaws of 60/40 portfolio allocation and an overreliance on historical correlation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, allocations for growth, recession, inflation, and deflationary periods (see Permanent Portfolio or Artemis’s Dragon Portfolio) are more fundamentally diversified portfolios, enabling rebalancing when markets present opportunities. This includes selling winners and re-balancing regularly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In evaluating the impact of a 3% BTC-USD allocation to a 60/40 portfolio from 2017 to the end of May 2022, investors would still be significantly ahead.  Importantly, BTC has faced three significant ‘crypto winters’ in this 5-year period, falling over 50% on each occasion. (Dec 2017-Dec 2018 fell more than 83%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following chart and table of performance include regular re-balancing (quarterly) of a portfolio comprised of 60% SP 500, 30% TLT (20-year US bonds) and 10% ST vanguard treasury compared with a portfolio of 60% SP 500, 30% TLT (20-year US bonds), 7% ST vanguard treasury, and 3% BTCUSD.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1494" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image.png" alt="" width="1302" height="675" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image.png 1302w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-300x156.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-1024x531.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-768x398.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1302px) 100vw, 1302px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1495" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc.jpg" alt="" width="1871" height="803" data-wp-editing="1" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc.jpg 1871w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-300x129.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-1024x439.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-768x330.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-1536x659.jpg 1536w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-1568x673.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1871px) 100vw, 1871px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As highlighted above, SP 500 and TLT (20 year) have weighed heavily in the performance attribution in this macro winter. While crypto assets have not provided diversification in this environment, they certainly are not the main culprits of capital destruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active portfolio management and the ability to take profit on the way up, rebalance, and conversely, in this environment, re-balance from cash and outperforming defensive assets into high quality risk assets at depressed pricing should continue to serve investors well.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, risk assets, including small cap innovative technology, have a role to play in prudent investment portfolios.  While no one has 100% certainty on how long this macro winter will last or how far risk assets may fall, an environment for growth assets will return at some point in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our view, Bitcoin and Ethereum are credible innovative technologies that will exist and thrive as the adoption of blockchain, smart contracts and non-inflationary assets continue to grow.  Other technology, including AAPL, AMZN, high-quality smaller cap technology companies and new digital assets, will go through a re-rating in this macro winter, and all survivors will build into the next cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sizing of higher volatile assets in a portfolio, especially within the nascent digital asset class, should be represented in small allocations.  However, as illustrated, small allocations can have a meaningful positive asymmetric impact on portfolio returns and improved risk adjusted returns &#8211; especially for investors that re-balance regularly.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Crypto-Powered Future is Already Here</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing is essentially an attempt to predict the future by allocating capital to the most promising companies, technologies, or economic models, adjusted for risk tolerance. In December 2003, William Gibson, one of the most influential Cyberpunk authors, wrote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;The future is already here – it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that some people are already doing and experiencing the futuristic things that the larger population will see as commonplace in the near future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crypto-powered, decentralized, and blockchain-enabled future world is already here; it just hasn’t reached everyone yet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Crypto is eating the world, and it’s happening faster than you think</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years ago in August 2011, Internet pioneer and visionary venture capitalist, Marc Andreesen, published a blog in the Wall Street Journal called, </span><a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Software Is Eating the World</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In it, he described how Software and Web companies were disrupting and supplanting many real-world industries and legacy business models, and at the same time dispelled arguments that this was a dangerous bubble similar to the Dot Com era of the late 1990’s. He should know. Marc was a founder of Netscape, which developed the world’s first user-friendly Web browser, and whose IPO in 1995 sparked that boom and launched the beginning of the Internet Age. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eventual ubiquity and inevitably of Software and the Web looks blindingly obvious with the benefit of hindsight, but it was not well understood nor distributed at the time. The same arguments are now being made against Crypto; that it’s an unsustainable and speculative bubble, a niche technology used by a minority of people, and a fad that will be regulated out of existence if it becomes too successful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto combines software with cryptography and decentralized blockchain technology, and is powered by network effects, viral propagation, consensus governance mechanisms, and transparent financial and behavioral incentives. Many industry participants including Alex Mashinsky and Raoul Paul have already observed that ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now eating the world’, disrupting traditional financial markets and even some of the same software business models that Marc wrote about. Unsurprisingly, Andreesen Horowitz was an early </span><a href="https://a16z.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters-nyt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocate of Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2014, and recently raised a second $2.2 billion venture capital fund to invest in this emerging asset class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Apollo Capital, it is our belief that we have already entered a new era (perhaps ‘the Crypto Age’) where large parts of our daily lives – work, social networks, financial capital, human interaction, entertainment, gaming, music, and artistic creativity – will be digitized and increasingly tokenized to be stored and exchanged on a blockchain. These will be overlapping and interacting networks of value that will benefit from Metcalfe’s Law of exponential growth. Few understand that we are in the midst of a revolution in money, finance, and culture that is in the early days of adoption and price discovery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Traditional Finance is the Main Course</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto has found a major product-market fit in the area of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). DeFi is an emerging ecosystem of financial applications and interoperable protocols built on blockchain technology that has begun eating away at the multi-hundred trillion dollar capital markets including borrowing and lending, market-making, store of value, fixed income, derivatives, foreign exchange, payments, remittances, mortgages, asset management, and interest rate swaps, among others – all without a real world financial intermediary. Instead, ‘smart contracts’, written in software code, control the execution of every transaction, removing counterparty risk and the need for a centralized authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a Cambrian explosion of new DeFi projects, and enormous amounts of capital are already flowing into DeFi as the Total Value Locked (TVL) has reached $195 billion, an 830% increase so far this year. Much of the activity is taking place on the Ethereum network, which settles $500 billion of transactions each month and is on pace to settle $8 trillion in 2021, the most in Crypto. ETH, the native token of Ethereum, which generates more than $20 million in daily fees for network miners, is predicted to become a deflationary asset (the total supply decreases over time) starting in 2022 with its migration to a ‘proof of stake’ consensus model. ETH is being described as ‘ultra-sound money’; a potentially superior store of value and a medium of exchange for a wide range of Internet transactions. Compared to Bitcoin’s singular value proposition of an immutable digital store of value, Ethereum, as the original smart contract platform, has many more use cases in DeFi. The Lightning Network is a “Layer 2” scaling protocol that has been in development for years and will enable faster transactions and payments on the Bitcoin network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The innovative economic structures of the future will not be traditional corporations, but rather </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/2021/07/the-era-of-the-dao/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DAOs), operated by volunteer communities of software and capital contributors with democratic and transparent governance policies enacted by proposal voting according to the ownership of protocol tokens. For Crypto projects, DAOs will replace highly regulated legal and hierarchical structures that are controlled by Board of Directors, full-time management teams, and equity shareholders. Driven by open source software, Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), rather than centralized Stock Exchanges, facilitate roughly $60 billion per month of permissionless peer-to-peer trading, creating high liquidity for the vast majority of tokens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another relatively recent innovation, US-dollar pegged stablecoins, have a current market value of $130 billion and enable near instant transfer of value anywhere in the world. Anyone who has tried to wire money overseas (even to an account they own) knows the pain, delay, and limitations of the byzantine and antiquated banking system. In free markets, improved user experience and reduced cost will always prevail over incumbent solutions. The commercialization of the Web has proven this beyond any doubt. Traditional Banks will either soon experience NGMI (“Not Gonna Make It”), or if they want to retain customer deposits, plug directly into DeFi platforms to offer innovative payment and yield products. The leading centralized Crypto exchange, Coinbase, has announced it will allow customers to deposit paychecks directly to their accounts. Shots fired!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>The Web, Culture, and Gaming will be Dessert</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto will infiltrate and permeate just about everything that’s accessible online, and onboard a large new audience to the Crypto asset ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook, with 2.9 billion global users, recently announced it is betting the company’s future on transitioning into a Metaverse company, and is pursuing plans to launch a Crypto stablecoin called Diem. PayPal has integrated Crypto into its global person-to-person and e-commerce payment network. Visa, Mastercard, and Verifone are doing likewise. Reddit, the Web’s largest discussion board platform, launched an Ethereum-based rewards program for community members. Amazon has been rumored to be researching a token strategy. Companies like Microsoft, KFC, The Dallas Mavericks, Norwegian Air, and countless online stores already accept payment in Crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the first Non-Fungible Token was minted on a blockchain in 2014, NFTs (often priced in ETH) really hit the popular zeitgeist in late 2020 with major drops by artists like Beeple and Trevor Jones setting sales records that rivaled the Masters of the traditional fine art world. EtherRocks, Bored Apes, and Crypto Punks are the new ultimate status symbol assets (or “flex”) with collectors now using these unique digital NFTs as online identity avatars. Twitter will soon allow its 350 million users to authenticate their ownership of NFTs on the platform. Jack Dorsey has integrated Bitcoin into both Square, for investment and trading, and Twitter, for tipping and payments. Multi-chain wallets for storing and transacting in Crypto are already integrated into Web browsers and likely soon into Apple Wallet and Google Pay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online gaming is adopting in-game NFTs and has created a ‘Play-To-Earn’ (P2E) business model where players receive tokens and unique items as rewards, based on their skill and achievements. The leading P2E game, Axie Infinity, is on track to generate $1.4 billion in 2021 revenue and has 350,000 daily players, mostly in the Philippines, who are often earning enough to make a living and support their families. Axie’s $35 billion market cap places it in the top five most valuable gaming companies in the world. Using NFTs, cross-game marketplaces, and the blockchain to verify and transport their avatars and items, Crypto game players will interact in an interoperable virtual universe (aka “The Metaverse”). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fashion and music industries will also incorporate NFTs. Dolce &amp; Gabbana recently sold their first NFT collection for $5.65 million. Songs will soon be tokenized so that fans can participate in their ownership and earn royalties from their favorite artists, establishing music as a new form of investment. NFTs will exist at the intersection of culture and finance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking this trend to its logical and fullest expression, we expect the major Social Networks, gaming companies, music streamers, and Web services will integrate Crypto and decentralize their platforms to some degree. The massive global outage of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp is a glaring example of why a decentralized Web is the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Dinero Mágico de Internet</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very few people (other than Jack Mallers from Strike) expected a country to adopt Crypto in 2021, and yet El Salvador, which translates to “The Savior”, made Bitcoin legal tender alongside the almighty US dollar in June. According to President Nayib Bukele</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 million people or nearly half of the 6.4 million Salvadorans are already actively using the state-backed Chivo Bitcoin wallet. That is more accounts than any single bank in the country and likely on track to exceed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banks in the country. Talk about banking the unbanked!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its historical volatility, Bitcoin is the best performing asset of any kind over the last 10 years. Much concern has been expressed over Bitcoin’s power usage and carbon footprint, and perhaps this is warranted, but Bitcoin will have positive benefits as it monetizes the stranded power from legacy utilities and remote renewable sources. Electric utilities in the US are turning to Bitcoin mining to capture off-peak power and for load balancing. Ukraine has formally legalized Crypto and is exploring Bitcoin mining using nuclear power. Laos and Paraguay are legalizing Bitcoin trading and have announced plans to utilize excess hydro-generated power for mining. El Salvador’s state-owned power company will provide mining facilities with cheap, clean geothermal energy, harnessed from the country&#8217;s volcanoes. Understandably, very few people want to live anywhere near a volcano and the lack of a robust electricity grid can make transmitting power to urban centers uneconomical. Bitcoin fixes this. The limitless geothermal energy can be transformed into digital value and transmitted cheaply. Think of this as a store of abundant energy in a digital battery, or even digital gold that can be dug up and transmitted at the speed of light. In doing so, Bitcoin may ultimately hasten the adoption of renewable energy worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare this forward thinking to the United States where the SEC is still dragging its heels on approving any of the 18 Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications on file. It’s only a matter of time, though, and this will be a major step forward to widespread adoption of Crypto, triggering a huge inflow of new capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong><i>Software Disruption Meets the Velocity of Capital</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Crypto, the disruptive forces of software (digital distribution, iterative improvements, and decentralized contribution) combine with the velocity of capital (highly fluid liquidity that seeks yield, removes inefficiencies and intermediaries) to create a powerful, global, and permissionless 24/7 digital free market whose goal is adoption, efficiency, and exchange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are two relentless and insatiable forces that will drive widespread adoption and propagate Crypto through their inherent positive feedback loops across concentric networks of value. Money is becoming programmable, and the definition of and types of money will evolve and their uses will mushroom. Crypto is truly “the future of finance”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto has the incredible advantage of leveraging decades of global Internet and mobile infrastructure investment and adoption that will facilitate its exponential growth. Roughly 48% of the world&#8217;s population, or 3.8 billion people, own a smartphone and can access decentralized browser-based Crypto and DeFi platforms, democratizing financial inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin, and the entire Crypto movement, was born out of the Global Financial Crisis in 2009, and the ongoing debasement of Fiat currencies, negative real yields, and the growing distrust of government and financial institutions have proven powerful accelerants. The “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/O1hCLBTD5RM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money Printer go Brrr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” meme has done more to explain the current Central Bank monetary policy than any Economics textbook. Innovative companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Galaxy Digital have adopted Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset to help solve the ‘</span><a href="https://youtu.be/WrR95PFYDFQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">melting ice cube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ problem of Fiat currency, as Michael Saylor calls it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With BTC at $47,000 and ETH at $3,300, the entire Crypto market is valued at roughly $2.1 trillion, which would rank it between the market caps of Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft. For reference, the global stock markets are valued at $95 trillion, gold at $11 trillion, the broad M2 money supply is another $100 trillion, and outstanding bonds are valued at $130 trillion. With the current trajectory and inertia, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine Crypto’s market cap increasing 3-10x over the next decade. Bullish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>The Final Boss</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the major risks to Crypto&#8217;s success – technology, value proposition, economic model, product-market fit, and consumer and institutional adoption – are well on the way to being solved. What’s left to overcome? Nation State attacks and unreasonable financial regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve already seen a concerted, multi-year attack by China with its “banning of Crypto” (annually since 2013!) and it’s recent total ban on Bitcoin mining, which caused a mass exodus of miners, a broad market panic sell-off, and a significant impact to the network hash rate (a measure of the processing power that secures the Bitcoin network). Impressively, this forced a dramatic decentralization of the network, which is now reassembling itself in more favorable jurisdictions like the US, Canada, Russia, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and Kazakhstan with the </span><a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hash rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already back to mid-May 2021 levels. This is a long-term positive, removes a key vulnerability, and has proven the Bitcoin network’s resilience and antifragility. Is the Law of Unintended Consequences a thing in China?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems the Final Boss for Crypto to defeat is the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission and what form the now certain regulation will take. Our expectation is that regulation will be a long-term positive as the framework will provide legal, tax, and regulatory certainty, and more formally integrate Crypto into the global economy, allowing broad participation from investment funds, retirement accounts, corporate treasuries, and sovereign wealth funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Apollo Capital, we expect significant ongoing market volatility in the short-term, but we are exceptionally confident in the long-term fundamental thesis that Crypto will power the new decentralized financial infrastructure of Web 3.0. The profound and disruptive innovation will continue despite token price fluctuations, and provide an asymmetric return opportunity for investors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Number Go Up</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To adapt a phrase about Software disruption from Marc Andreesen in 2011, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next 10 years, the battles between incumbents and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-powered insurgents will be epic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. However, Crypto will be different; globally inclusive, open source, censorship resistant, spearheaded by decentralized volunteer communities applying their own capital and ingenuity, fueled by memes and a desire to effect real change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward ten years from now, Crypto’s rise will look obvious and inevitable&#8230; just as the dominance of Software and the Web do today.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enormous credit and gratitude to Marc Andreesen, Mike Novogratz, Jack Mallers, Jack Dorsey, Michael Saylor, Elon Musk, President Nayib Bukele, Satoshi Nakamoto, and Vitalik Buterin for their leadership and inspiration. </span></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s blog post will be covering significant events that have occurred over the past week that are accelerating crypto assets&#8217; quest for mainstream adoption. These were the &#8220;B-word&#8221; conference organised by the Crypto Council Of Innovation, news from Fidelity Digital regarding institutional demand for crypto exposure and lastly, announcements of Amazon&#8217;s new hiring remit for hiring blockchain experts in anticipation of setting up payment rails for cryptocurrency payments on the world&#8217;s largest e-commerce platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This chain of events has converged to produce large moves to the upside for crypto assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum jumping 29.70% and 34.60%, respectively, from their weekly lows. While bullish news contributed to the start of the uptick in crypto asset prices, a large volume of ‘Short Interest Liquidations’ on the 27th of July pushed prices to weekly highs. The ‘short squeeze’ was a welcomed surprise for many crypto asset market participants such as Apollo Capital. A summary of the three events is provided below, with their significance on the crypto-asset industry described.</span></p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-527" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-27-at-1.19.40-pm-600x340.png" alt="" width="722" height="409" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Institutional Recognition Growing </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Asset&#8217;s mainstream adoption can only be made possible via institutional buy-in. As a result, investment banks and large funds have been slowly building their crypto trading, advisory and research capabilities and offering products to enable other wholesale and institutional investors exposure to digital assets. For example, earlier this month, Bank of America reportedly announced the inception of a new </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bank-of-america-reportedly-establishes-crypto-research-team"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto research team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently, there has been other bullish news for crypto&#8217;s asset recognition among the large institutions. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonytellez/2021/07/23/fidelity-claims-70-of-institutional-investors-want-crypto-but-theres-a-catch/?sh=684e1a0522cc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fidelity Digital has revealed the strong demand for advisors, family offices, pensions, hedge funds, and endowments worldwide to have crypto-asset exposure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their portfolio, with 7/10 confirming this sentiment. Additionally, 9/10 respondents also demonstrated their interest in digital assets by disclosing they expect to have crypto allocations in their clients or institutions portfolios over the next five years. Naturally, these surveys may have a sample bias as they have been inducted via Fidelity Digital Assets and juxtaposed Australia’s institutional investors. The results might tell a different story, however looking back up to 24 months, there is a distinct trend upwards in adoption. Nations are beginning to play a significant role in adoption too, as we know with El Salvador deeming Bitcoin legal tender and countries such as Canada and Europe contributing to adoption via their </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2021/07/23/psst-you-can-get-a-bitcoin-etf-here/?sh=643c66f472e9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF offerings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This trend will continue as larger financial institutions slowly take on more exposure to crypto-assets as they become gentrified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>E-Commerce Giant Enters The Arena</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto tabloids are erupting on the news regarding Amazon and their newly advertised employment request for a &#8216;</span><a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1644513/digital-currency-and-blockchain-product-lead"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Currency and Blockchain Product Lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216; along with 70 other openings for blockchain specialists. The new role is for the payments acceptance and experience team, which will focus on &#8216;owning the vision and strategy for Amazon&#8217;s Digital Currency and Blockchain strategy and product roadmap&#8217;. Since this advertisement has been made public, the market has begun speculating on avenues the tech giant will take towards providing crypto assets as a form of payment, something it does not do today. An unknown source has stated </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/amazon-plans-to-accept-bitcoin-payments-this-year-claims-insider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon claims to begin accepting Bitcoin by Q4 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On top of that, the source also disclosed, &#8220;Amazon is said to be exploring the creation of its Cryptocurrency&#8217;. Supporting this source were the actions Amazon took in 2017 by buying three cryptocurrency web addresses but did not disclose why at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of a corporation developing a native digital currency is not a foreign one and has picked up traction over the past few months. Earlier this month, an article, &#8216;We Were Looking At&#8217;, detailed the Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest in developing a digital currency after a meeting with Jerome Powell and Coinbase Global executives were made publicly available. Another tech giant Apple seems to be following suit with Amazon as they are now advertising for roles of a similar nature, e.g. </span><a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200247094/business-development-manager-alternative-payments?team=MKTG"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Development Manager, Alternative Payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Undoubtedly large tech companies incorporating crypto assets as payment rails and developing infrastructure to support it is a massive bull signal for the industry as a whole.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The B-word Conference: </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market knew they were not finished with seeing Elon Musk on a public stage talking about crypto assets. They were unsure about the angle he would take when asked about the longevity, fundamentals, ESG concerns and personal views on Bitcoin. Elon Musk&#8217;s previous public statements on Bitcoin have been inconsistent. The main event of the B-word conference was a moderated conversation consisting of Square Crypto Lead, Steve Lee, CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, Elon Musk, CEO of Twitter Inc. and Square Inc, Jack Dorsey and CIO of ARK Invest Cathy Wood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall the publicly streamed conversation was a bullish and educational discussion about Bitcoin. Below are some </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-21/bitcoin-jumps-past-32-000-as-musk-says-spacex-owns-token"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highlights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the conversation:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk debunked some myths about his irrational crypto behaviour and perceptions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the main topic of discussion was Bitcoin, Musk highlighted he owns Ethereum and Dogecoin.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk claimed Tesla and SpaceX both have Bitcoin on their balance sheets with no plans to sell.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk claimed Tesla will resume accepting Bitcoin if the network indicates proof of renewable energy usage in 50% of mining activity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dorsey and Musk both had a friendly rapport when discussing Bitcoin. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wood said corporations should consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, partly as a hedge against deflation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference and its positive sentiments for crypto ownership confirm that all three panellists endorse Bitcoin. Looking back on the past week, it is clear the conference was a contributing factor to the Bitcoin’ strong price bounce off $US 30,000, where it has been fluctuating for the past two months.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1626320840365_188" class=""><strong id="yui_3_17_2_1_1626320840365_187">What are Central Bank Digital Currencies?</strong></p>
<p class="">Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital fiat currencies issued directly by central banks.</p>
<p class="">The crucial distinction between digital fiat currencies and the digital currency in our bank accounts appears to be how they are issued. In the former, only commercial banks and certain financial institutions can hold electronic central bank money, in the form of ‘reserves.’ Consumers therefore have access to money through commercial banks, which in turn hold central bank money. CBDCs might diminish the role of commercial banks, allowing households and businesses to directly make payments and store value using an electronic form of central bank money. We can think of a CBDC as a direct relationship between the user of money, be it a household or business, and the issuer of money, the central bank.</p>
<p class="">CBDCs are not crypto assets. While they may use a blockchain in their technological architecture, they are in principle different to crypto assets. Crypto assets are typically decentralised and permissionless. Anyone can use crypto assets and no one group or party is in control. CBDCs on the other hand are centralised and permissioned. The Bank of England states that “there is no reason CBDC could not be built using centralised technology.” Users must request permission to use CBDCs.</p>
<p class="">Another key difference is central banks can easily increase the supply of CBDCs. On the other hand, the supply and issuance of crypto assets is typically known and finite.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>The Promise of CBDCs</strong></p>
<p class="">Many central banks around the world are considering and indeed have started piloting CBDCs. A summary of the key theoretical benefits of CBDCs includes:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Faster settlement times &#8211; despite recent improvements in interbank transfers, at least domestically, we are all familiar with the difficulties of processing bank transfers. CBDCs will likely process immediately, allowing more efficient payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Opening hours &#8211; many of us are also familiar with the difficulties in processing transfers outside bank hours. CBDCs will operate 24/7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">CBDCs may play the role of a risk-free stablecoin. Indeed, the Bank of England highlights a “CBDC may also provide safer payment services than new forms of privately issued money‑like instruments, such as stablecoins.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Government control &#8211; CBDCs will likely help governments control and audit the money supply, something which is almost impossible with bank notes. An example of this was the suggestion of a “digital dollar” in US Congress to help more effectively deliver rounds of direct stimulus to the American people as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While this example was subsequently quashed, in theory, it may be a benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">No credit risk &#8211; when consumers hold dollars in a commercial bank, they take on the credit risk of the bank. If the bank were to become insolvent, consumers may lose their funds. There is no credit risk with CBDCs as it is a direct link with the central bank. However, the downside of this is holdings might not earn interest on deposits and consumers might not have access to credit and other services offered by commercial banks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">There are a number of other suggested benefits to CBDCs. We also suggest there would likely be a number of unknown benefits, benefits that typically arise from a technology, once it is used by thousands of creative minds. Many of the benefits are predictable, but many are not known until innovative computer scientists and entrepreneurs come up with creative ways to implement and use the technology. This is not unlike the promise of crypto assets themselves.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>The Risks of CBDCs</strong></p>
<p class="">The primary risk of CBDCs is the disintermediation of commercial banks. What role will commercial banks play if CBDCs allow a direct relationship between a central bank and users? The Bank of England states “some disintermediation would be inevitable” and “disintermediation would result in a lower total volume of funding for banks.” The central banks do not want a CBDC to become a major form of store of value. If users transfer their holdings to CBDCs, it may impact the ability of commercial banks to carry on their activities, such as credit facilities for other customers. The issuance of a CBDC somewhat ironically may impact on the money supply. A possible solution here is tiered remuneration, where central banks pay declining interest rates for larger holdings of CBDCs. Consumers would in theory only use the CBDCs for payments, but hold the majority of their funds at commercial banks offering commercial interest rates.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Criticisms of CBDCs</strong></p>
<p class="">In addition to the risk above, many commentators have been highly critical of CBDCs. The critics focus on privacy, noting that central banks and governments may have an ulterior motive of increased surveillance on citizens. As one commentator put it, using a CBDC “basically complete[s] the loop for the gov&#8217;t, eliminating the need to go through intermediaries to get your data.”</p>
<p class="">The Australian government recently passed a law banning cash payments of greater than $10,000. Offenders can be jailed for up to two years. Many critics of this law have argued that the government should not interfere with their legal right to spend money how they wish. The Government on the other hand has argued that the law is intended to fight the black economy, stamping out tax evasion and money laundering.</p>
<p class="">As laws like this are passed, in addition to the law allowing a ‘backdoor’ into communications applications using encryption, it appears that privacy concerns associated with a CBDC are valid. Will the relationship be strictly between a central bank and user, or will the tax agencies and other government departments have direct access to our financial data?</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Global Approaches</strong></p>
<p class="">The Bahamas was the first country to launch a pilot CBDC programme. The pilot was launched in December 2019 with a full rollout expected in the second half of 2020. Sweden is already one of the most cashless societies in the world and it is testing an e-krona for a one year pilot programme. The e-krona is developed by Accenture using the Corda enterprise blockchain.</p>
<p class="">The Bank of England has released a <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/paper/2020/central-bank-digital-currency-opportunities-challenges-and-design.pdf">discussion paper</a> (well worth a read for those looking for a deeper understanding). The discussion paper makes a number of interesting points:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">The Bank of England is charged with considering what kind of money and payments will be needed to meet the needs of an increasingly digital economy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Banknotes — the Bank’s most accessible form of money — are being used less frequently to make payments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">A CBDC will be a complement to physical banknotes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">A CBDC would be equally safe and free of credit risk as physical cash, but could be more convenient as a means of payment for both households and businesses, particularly for electronic and remote payments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">A domestic CBDC might be an enabler of better cross-border payments in the future</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">A CBDC might involve Payment Interface Providers which could build ‘overlay services’ &#8211; services might meet future payment needs by enabling programmable money, smart contracts and micropayments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">A CBDC could increase the availability and usability of central bank money, helping to support monetary policy and financial stability, and could help to avoid the risks of new forms of private money creation, such as stablecoins</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">The European Central Bank has issued a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2351~c8c18bbd60.en.pdf">working paper</a> which on our reading, highlights similar issues to the Bank of England’s discussion paper.</p>
<p class="">Our sources inform us that China is particularly close to issuing a digital yuan. The People’s Bank of China reported in January that it is progressing smoothly with its plans of a government-backed digital currency. Apparently the digital currency has been five years in the making. The Chinese case is particularly interesting, and may make criticisms of CBDCs relevant, particularly as they relate to surveillance of citizens. A country that closely scrutinises everything that is said and done, now might have the ability to closely scrutinise everything that is spent.</p>
<p class="">In Australia, the RBA has stated there has been no case established for issuing a CBDC, citing likely low demand from households which already have access to “digital money in the form of commercial bank deposits that provide payment services, are interest-bearing and are protected (up to $250,000 per account) by the Financial Claims Scheme.” Instead, the RBA appears to be focussing its efforts on a “wholesale” CBDC for use by wholesale market participants in specialised payment and settlement systems. The RBA cites potential benefits including more efficient payments, atomic transactions and programmable money. We find the RBA’s approach a narrow-minded. These benefits could equally apply to a “retail CBDC” with potential for a raft of innovation by making it available to a greater population.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Alternative to the USD</strong></p>
<p class="">Mark Carney, the outgoing Governor of the Bank of England, has made a novel suggestion that we think is worth mentioning in the discussion of CBDCs. Carney has suggested a new virtual currency backed by a basket of international currencies. Carney points out the problems with the world’s reliance on the US Dollar. The US accounts for only 10 percent of global trade and 15 percent of global GDP but half of trade invoices and two thirds of securities are priced in US Dollars. US interest rate and exchange rate policy is effectively exported to other parts of the world. He has suggested creating a “synthetic hegemonic currency . . . provided . . . perhaps through a network of central bank digital currencies.”</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">&#8212;</p>
<p class="">CBDCs are not crypto assets. They are likely to be fundamentally different in their purpose and architecture. As people that fundamentally believe in the benefits of technology, Apollo Capital is excited to see how they might improve our financial system, particularly in regards to payments. It is possible that they compete against crypto asset stablecoins, taking the role of a digital medium of exchange. However, we do not think they will challenge Bitcoin and store of value like crypto assets, or be compatible with decentralised finance protocols.</p>

<p class="">In Computer Science a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protocol</a> is a specification of the rules of a communication system — it’s a foundational standard that we can lean on and build more complex applications on top of.</p>
<p class="">In Western democracies, the fundamental rights, or put another way, the protocol of a society is enshrined in its constitution. The United States is well known to have strong protections for press freedom and free speech in its Bill of Rights. Likewise, many other democracies such as Britain and Sweden have strong protections for free speech. Australia is the Western democracy standing out in this regards, and not for a good reason. Australia is without strong press freedom or free speech protected by its constitution. In fact, recent years have seen a deterioration in that regard. We have recently seen a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/04/federal-police-raid-home-of-news-corp-journalist-annika-smethurst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journalist</a> and a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-15/abc-raids-australian-federal-police-press-freedom/11309810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news agency</a> being raided by the federal police, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-03/ato-whistleblower-facing-prison-says-he-almost-died-from-stress/11167954" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ATO whistleblower is facing jail time</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/a-top-cardinals-sex-abuse-conviction-is-huge-news-in-australia-but-the-media-cant-report-it-there/2018/12/12/49c0eb68-fe27-11e8-83c0-b06139e540e5_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a gag order put on media in relation to the Catholic cardinal sexual abuse case</a>, and perhaps the most systematic dangerous of them all, <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/dangerous-overreach-on-encryption-leaves-backdoor-open-for-criminals-20181214-p50mak.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an encryption bill</a> weakening our communications. This is what the press is protesting about in Australia by for one day censoring their first page.</p>
<p class="">Protocols are really hard to change — they’re in fact designed that way for a good reason, and sadly we don’t see strong protections coming to Australia anytime soon.</p>

<p class="">However technology can perhaps provide some remedy. Below are some example of where cryptography is able to provide civil liberties independent of where in the world you happen to live.</p>
<p class=""><strong>1. Secure Communication</strong></p>
<p class="">The cypherpunks, a movement started in the late 1980s., aimed to achieve privacy and security through proactive use of cryptography. Their <a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manifesto</a> reads: “Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. … We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy … We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. … Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and … we’re going to write it.”</p>
<p class="">They realised early on that technology can create a place of freedom, some new ground that others can’t infringe on.</p>
<p class="">With the help of cryptography such as end-to-end encryption we can communicate freely and no one can eaves drop or censor that communication. Cryptography is a unique technology in that it is many orders of magnitude easier to protect encrypted messages than to attack the same. This asymmetry is also what crypto assets depend on.</p>
<p class="">Out of this movement we got things like encrypted email. Cypherpunk and cryptographer Phil Zimmerman created a new protocol for secure email communication called PGP.</p>
<p class=""><strong>2. Secure Assets</strong></p>
<p class="">For assets, crypto offers an alternative to today’s dependency on centralised institutions. These are opt-in immutable networks with strong protections against censorship.</p>
<p class="">Nick Szabo, leading crypto though leader and polymath, recently introduced the concept of deep safety to assets:</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">We can think of today’s assets in three layers:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class=""><strong>Digital centralised — these have poor deep safety.</strong> Examples would be money in your bank account, shares held by your broker, or a Gold ETF. Digital centralised assets are totally dependent on the goodwill of centralised organisations or companies. That trust has been abused throughout history in many places of the world. Countries with strong protections on the protocol level such as the US have been successful in fulfilling this trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""><strong>Physical assets — better deep safety. </strong>Examples Szabo provides above include Real Estate and Gold. Physical assets have been the best protection throughout history because they were the best alternative. However they have the <a href="https://twitter.com/nickszabo4/status/992056245707128836?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severe flaw</a> being dependent on un-secure physical locality and local transactions. It is fundamentally hard to protect something physical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""><strong>Trust-minimised crypto networks — unprecedented deep safety</strong>. Examples include crypto assets such as Bitcoin. Cryptography gives us unprecedented security, once we encrypt something and we do it properly, in a probabilistic sense it is game-over for the attacker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class=""><strong>3. Secure Contracts</strong></p>
<p class="">With the rise of smart contract platforms like Ethereum, agreements can be made purely based on computer code.</p>
<p class="">Lending platform Compound currently has $153M of capital earning interest across 7 markets. Implemented correctly, the lenders on these markets are not dependent on the solvency of a single financial institution — instead security is coded in algorithms. It is trust-minimised in the sense that access and security is not in the hands of humans.</p>
<p class="">Decentralised exchanges use smart contracts to remove the third-party risk in trading. Depositing assets on a centralised exchange exposes you to counter-party risk as you give up direct ownership of those assets. With smart contracts we can trade in a trust-minimised way with minimal third party risk. This brings unparalleled security to trading.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p class="">The trust-minimisation of crypto networks means we can place less trust in organisations and fallible humans and instead use software to create digital bearer instruments, transfer value peer-to-peer and create other, more complicated contracts running purely on unstoppable software. This increases social scalability as we can trade and make agreements with anyone in the world without having to trust a third party. This is what we call the Trust Revolution:</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">While we don’t have much hope of a top-down movement rewriting the protocol of the society, by reducing the amount of trust we have to place in our current institutions in the first place, their importance is likely to decrease over time. Crypto brings us a glimpse of hope as more and more people are opting in to this new way of transacting offering permissionless financial freedom to everyone in the world.</p>

<p class="">President Trump recently shared his thoughts on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. We were unsurprised to learn that he is not a crypto enthusiast. The President’s concern that crypto assets are “based on thin air” is not uncommon. Crypto assets are not backed by anything. But the premise that an asset cannot be valuable if it is not backed by something is short-sighted. Gold, fiat currencies and paintings are all valuable assets not backed by anything. The true determinant of whether something is valuable is the tension between supply and demand for that particular asset.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">First, let’s start with valuing assets. How do we value assets? The simple answer to this age old question is the value of anything comes down to what someone is willing to pay for it. The financial services industry has developed models and techniques to determine the value of a variety of assets. While these models might help determine a range of potential values, the inputs to the models inevitably involve a great deal of subjectivity. (Let’s consider the alternative. If the models didn’t involve subjectivity, everyone would use the same inputs, the models would provide the same answers and asset prices wouldn’t fluctuate). Valuation is art as much as it is science and while these models may help, the true value of an asset comes down to what someone is willing to pay for it. Any other definition can only be theoretical.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">How do we work out what someone is willing to pay for an asset? The answer: markets and the forces of supply and demand. Markets exist to facilitate the trade of assets. Less liquid assets are traded infrequently and price discovery is more difficult. Supply and demand are the forces that drive markets. Supply comes from issuing new assets and from sellers of existing assets. Demand comes from buyers looking to purchase at an attractive price. The value of any asset comes from the ever-present tension between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Markets tell us that crypto assets are valuable. Crypto markets are currently worth around USD$250bn. That’s a lot of value based on thin air! As is the case with every other asset class, supply and demand determines the value of crypto assets. Supply comes from new assets, increasing supply of existing assets and sellers. Demand comes from the increasingly large number of people who are realising the value of crypto assets. The question is not “how are crypto assets worth anything if they’re not backed by anything?” Rather, the pertinent question is “what is it about crypto assets that makes them valuable”? The answer: crypto assets have unique characteristics that are unlike anything else known to mankind.</p>
<p class="">Crypto assets often have the following unique characteristics:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Scarcity &#8211; using Bitcoin as an example, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence. If we think of Bitcoin as money, this is ‘hard’ money. Unlike fiat currencies governed by central banks, it is impossible to print more bitcoin, thereby devaluing all the other bitcoin</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Digital &#8211; crypto assets are digital. The concept of assets in the digital ether is often difficult for people to grasp, they cannot touch or feel it and nor do they receive a share certificate. Native digital assets can be traded digitally with less friction than alternatives. As the world becomes more and more digital, digital assets make sense</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Utility &#8211; crypto assets can be used for a variety of purposes, with different assets suited to different means. People can use Bitcoin as a personal, unseizable bank account, and all they need is a smartphone and internet connection. Crypto assets are often programmable, leading to a number of novel use cases, often disrupting and disintermediating incumbents. The unique economic model of crypto assets means they can capture enormous amounts of value in the process.</p>

<p class="">Let’s compare Bitcoin to gold. Why is gold valuable today? The short answer is because of supply and demand. There is demand for gold because it has always been valuable, because thousands of years ago, a group of people decided that gold has a number of unique properties which meant it would function well as a form of money. Gold is somewhat scarce, so it cannot be duplicated and printed (unlike today’s fiat currencies). Gold is durable, so people can store their wealth with some degree of assurance. It is malleable so it can be shaped into functional coins. Gold is fungible, meaning any piece of gold is replaceable with another piece of gold. Gold, particularly when shaped into a coin, is portable, meaning it can be carried around and exchanged with other people to facilitate trade. Gold became valuable because of these properties. The people of the day decided that gold is valuable and should be valued. This cycle developed further and further until gold was recognised as being valuable, by people all over the world.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">It is important to note that this process did not happen overnight. Imagine presenting a group of people a new asset and proclaiming that it should be immediately valuable. It takes a long time for people to realise the value of a new asset class, as they become familiar with the asset and as network effects develop. Just as gold did not become valuable instantly, nor did crypto assets and nor will they realise their full value for some time.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">If we compare Bitcoin to Gold, Bitcoin’s properties are superior. Bitcoin is more scarce than gold, easier to transfer, more divisible, equally fungible and easier and cheaper to store. On top of this, Bitcoin is programmable and is impossible to seize, unlike gold in the United States in the 1930s which was seized by President Roosevelt. The only advantage gold has over Bitcoin is it’s shiny. In time, more and more people will realise Bitcoin’s superiority to gold, demand will increase and the value of Bitcoin will increase. The estimated market capitalisation of gold is between US$8 and US$10 trillion dollars. Given Bitcoin’s current market capitalisation of around US$170bn, we believe there is a strong case that Bitcoin will capture some of the value from the gold market which is around 50 times larger.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Fiat Currency</strong></p>
<p class="">When we talk about crypto assets as currencies, many compare to fiat currencies (US Dollar, Australian Dollar etc) which is “backed by governments.” I often smirk when I hear  people say the US Dollar is backed by the full faith and strength of the US government. The problem with this argument is this ‘backing’ exists until it doesn’t. Fiat currency is valuable, until it’s not. If macroeconomic problems creep in, people start to doubt the value of the currency. Once doubt creeps in, it can be a slippery slope until the currency is worthless.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Sadly, there is no clearer example of this than the current state in Venezuela. Hyperinflation has recently been reported at 10 million percent and the local Bolivar currency is worthless.</p>

<p class="">Let’s consider a painting by Claude Monet. A Monet painting is not backed by anything other than a canvas. The painting has no intrinsic value. Yet, it is undeniable Monet paintings are valuable. Different paintings by Monet will have different value, depending on the particular beauty of those paintings. And of course, paintings by Monet are scarce. Monet died in 1926, so we know that there will never be any more Monet paintings.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">We can draw a comparison to crypto assets. Crypto assets and rare paintings are backed by nothing, they have no intrinsic value. Yet this does not stop them from being valuable. Investors often ask why crypto assets are valuable if we can simply create new crypto assets. We would say the same about paintings. I can paint a picture of some water lilies at my local pond, but this will likely be no more valuable than any crypto asset I produce. The crypto asset that I create needs to have unique characteristics that are deemed valuable by the broader crypto community, just as my painting needs to be deemed valuable by the art community.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">&#8212;</p>
<p class="">The advantage that gold, fiat currencies and paintings have over crypto assets is they have been recognised as valuable for centuries, even thousands of years. Crypto assets are ten years old. It is highly unlikely that the value in the US Dollar will evaporate over a short period of time. While we think it is also unlikely this will happen in crypto assets, any unravelling of value in crypto assets is more likely than the same for assets which have long been recognised as valuable. In this regard, crypto assets are riskier than the traditional assets discussed, and this is well known and understood.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Crypto assets have unique properties that make them valuable. They are not backed by anything, they might be based on ‘thin air’, but this does not mean they are not valuable.</p>

<p>Crypto Assets cut the gordian knot of an increasingly regulated, compartmentalized, balkanized, complex financial system. We think that’s a pretty accurate metaphor for why crypto assets are important.</p>
<p>Before we had crypto assets, individuals had to trust centralised companies, institutions and central banks. Maybe more importantly, in doing business those institutions had to trust other institutions, creating layers of trust with a legal system around it. This has a created financial system that is:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li><strong>Increasingly complex</strong>. Financial engineering to manage risk between financial institutions and speculators has created an immense level of complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Opaque</strong>. Today, no one has a good grasp of the real state of the global financial system.</li>
<li><strong>Fragile</strong>. The current financial system tends to create great bubbles every 10–15 years with subsequent crashes that affect all of society and that leads to tax payer bailouts of our financial institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crypto assets can disintermediate the trusted third parties — it not just improves the current system but it can completely cut the gordian knot.</p>
<p>Here is the most simple example we can think of — how the gordian knot is cut in an international bank transfer:</p>

<p>In the latest financial crisis of 2008, undetected derivatives exposure lead to the collapse of the financial system and too big to fail financial institutions had to be bailed out by tax payers. That event ironically lead to even more complexity. The Economist notes in an article <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2012/02/18/too-big-not-to-fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘Too big not to fail’</a> that: ”The law that set up America’s banking system in 1864 ran to 29 pages; the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 went to 32 pages; the Banking Act that transformed American finance after the Wall Street Crash, commonly known as the Glass-Steagall act, spread out to 37 pages. Dodd-Frank is 848 pages long.”</p>
<p>Dodd-Frank created more agencies to overlook the system, more regulation and more complexity, more lawyers and more ways to game the system:</p>

<p>The red tape of Dodd-Frank is in stark contrast to the Open Financial System. We have seen the first glimpses of new financial primitives built on open blockchains, so far mostly on Ethereum. Credit, lending, derivatives markets open to anyone, anywhere. These new crypto powered systems are:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li><strong>Open and transparent</strong>. The rules are coded in software. There is no ambiguity about the state of the system.</li>
<li><strong>Permissionless</strong>. Open to anyone, anywhere. A mobile phone and Internet connection is all that is needed for access, no red tape.</li>
<li><strong>Unstoppable</strong>. Transactions are uncensorable and have the reach of the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, since these system are open source, and powered by crypto assets, the stakeholders are more distributed and the financial upside obtainable outside of Wall Street insiders.</p>
<p>Modern society has greatly increased the ability to organise humans on a greater and greater scale. But this social scalability has come at a cost of greater and greater complexity. Crypto networks solves this complexity problem of social scalability. Bitcoin created money seperate from the state. Bitcoin has global reach, without having to trust a third party. Now, other financial infrastructure is being recreated, seperate from financial institutions and the complexity of what Nick Szabo calls <a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘wet code’</a>.</p>
<p>Building a better financial system is an exciting future which will play out over the coming decade and that we want to be part of.</p>

<p>As crypto investors we are sometimes faced with the question about the usefulness of crypto. While we believe crypto assets can be the foundation for a new kind of trust infrastructure not just for money but more generally for contracts — we will here think about crypto as a form of money.</p>
<p>Living in Australia or another developed country in Europe or North America it can be hard to understand how important it is not having to trust the whims of the ruling party, a king or a brutal dictator with your money.</p>
<p>Holocaust survivor Ruth Weitz writes in <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Flares-Memory-Stories-Childhood-Holocaust-ebook/dp/B00VOLDI4E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551678940&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Flares+of+Memory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Flares of Memory — Stories of the Childhood during the Holocaust”</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hoping to escape from the concentration camp, I had sewed coins inside the waistband of my dress before going there. Within the hem of my dress I sewed my mother’s engagement ring, and I secured a gold chain inside my long braid of brown hair. I knew the consequences were death if I were caught, but I wanted to be prepared.</p></blockquote>
<p>Imaging if the jews trying to flew the holocaust had a means to protect their wealth by just remembering 12 words or a passphrase instead of hiding gold and risk being caught.</p>
<p>With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that becomes possible, a potential store of wealth which is becoming speech. Uncensorable speech free from political influence, and not possible to confiscate.</p>
<p>A current example of a country where people are really suffering under a brutal regime is Venezuela. Despite being a country with great natural resources its people are now struggling to survive. Due to poor governance, the inflation rate in Venezuela averaged over 32% from 1973 until 2017 before exploding in the last couple of years to over a million percent.</p>

<p>Carlos Hernandez, a Venezuelan economist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/sunday/venezuela-bitcoin-inflation-cryptocurrencies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describes</a> how Bitcoin has saved his family by keeping all his money in Bitcoin and only exchanging it for Bolivar when needed. He also tells the story how for anyone leaving Venezuela having money that is borderless and can be stored with just a passphrase in your head prevents people from getting their money seized by the military.</p>
<p>LocalBitcoins.com was founded in Finland in 2012 and has since then been a major peer-to-peer platform for buying and selling Bitcoin. The volume as measured in Bitcoin in Venezuela just hit a record on LocalBitcoins:</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are not yet private enough to protect us against all adversaries — maybe it most pressuring weakness. Supporting the opposition in a dictatorship using cryptocurrencies is still dangerous if you’re not very technical oriented and even so it is very hard to be sure that your transaction can’t be traced. There is still a lot of work to be done to make digital currencies as trustless, permissionless and as censorship resistant as possible.</p>
<p>Clear, however, is that as a store of value that can’t be seized or deflated by an irresponsible government is, as Carlos Hernandez puts it, “more than a buzzword when you live in a collapsing dictatorship.”</p>
<p>At least when it comes to the digital dimension we finally have an opportunity, thanks to crypto assets, of moving the discussion from “don’t be evil” to “can’t be evil”.</p>

<p>As I write this blog post, the Australian government has just enacted a decryption bill that<a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/govts-decryption-bill-can-only-lead-to-systemic-weaknesses-512390" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> according to experts can only lead to systemic weaknesses</a> that will put us all at risk.</p>
<p>Apple is protesting this bill in a letter saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Encryption is simply math. Any process that weakens the mathematical models that protect user data for anyone will by extension weaken the protections for everyone.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple and others are arguing that it is precisely because of the threats from criminals and terrorists that we need strong encryption.</p>
<p>Indeed it was likely software from an Israeli firm sold to governments and used by <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/02/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-whatsapp-messages-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saudi Arabia to spy on Jamal Khashoggi’s WhatsApp messages</a> that later lead to his brutal murder.</p>

<p>Privacy has always been front of mind for the cypherpunks in the digital cash and cryptocurrency community. For many of these people privacy is a basic human right.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin, money for the first time became indistinguishable from speech. This was predicted by cypherpunks decades ago. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_May" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timothy C. May</a>, a founding member of the cypherpunk movement, <a href="http://osaka.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/articles/tcmay.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in ’97</a> that ‘Digital Cash = Speech’. As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are open source software (arguably a form of speech), lines of code are now money.</p>

<p>Cypherpunks understood that if you like to support (including financially support) the opposition in say Saudi Arabia or Russia — a private means of communication might mean the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous, other cryptocurrencies offer in-built privacy. Dash was an early fork of Bitcoin offering a mixing technology for private transactions. Monero is a well known privacy focused coin using ring signatures which combines signatures to obfuscate the inputs to a transaction.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko_Wilcox-O%27Hearn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zooko Wilcox</a>, a cypherpunk who worked for David Chaum at DigiCash founded Zcash, it marked a new area in private cryptocurrencies. Zcash uses zero-knowledge proofs to provide absolute privacy. We can think of zero-knowledge proof as a way to proof something without revealing our secret. As an example, when I log-in to password manager Lastpass, that service has stored a hash of my password. Since a hash function as one-way function, it is enough to transmit the hash of the password to Lastpass, not the actual password — in other words, I don’t have to reveal my secret.</p>

<p>We are now close to the launch of a new technology which combines privacy with scalability. This technology is called MimbleWimble and one implementation of this, Grin, is set to launch next month. A <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/grins-michael-cordner-aka-yeastplume-on-implementing-mimblewimble" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent episode of the ‘What Bitcoin Did’</a> podcast gives a good overview of MimbleWimble and Grin. MimbleWimble transactions are based on proofs that input minus outputs are zero, thus very little data needs to be revealed and the blockchain will stay very small.</p>

<p>We are actively investing in some of the technologies helping to bring financial freedom to everyone in the world. Apollo Capital holds Bitcoin, Zcash, we invested in <a href="https://www.orchid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orchid</a> protocol which is building a more secure Internet and we look forward to the launch of Grin. For Bitcoin, the Lightning Network being built on top of Bitcoin could potentially provide more privacy there too.</p>
<p>The good news here is that cryptography is a rare technology where it is much easier (and not just a little bit easier) to defend yourself than to attack — due to a fundamental asymmetry behind public-key cryptography.</p>
<p>Open source + cryptography can and will continue to protect speech — both in the form of conversations and digital money. With the advent of encryption laws like we are seeing in Australia — open source software becomes a critical infrastructure for communication and free speech. With cryptocurrencies cypherpunks are extending the roam of free speech to digital money — a development very much still ongoing.</p>

<p><em>Our response to Nouriel Roubini’s October 2018 testimony for the US Senate<br />

<p><strong>Crypto Bubble (2017) and Crypto Apocalypse and Bust (2018) </strong></p>
<p>Roubini fails to recognise that Bitcoin and other crypto assets have gone through many bubble/bust cycles in the past. Anything that starts at a price of zero would need to go up a lot in price to gain significance. With Bitcoin’s ‘market cap’ at $75bn &#8211; it is still very small compared to other assets.</p>

<p>As seen, Bitcoin has gone through multiple retracements of 80%+, but the plateaus are getting higher and higher.</p>
<p><strong>Crypto is not money, not scalable </strong></p>
<p>Roubini is right that Bitcoin is not a good currency today or a store of value &#8211; it’s too volatile. While I think it might one day be used in payments, there is an increasing view of Bitcoin as a Digital Gold. Purely because the characteristics of Bitcoin is superior to that of gold. The value of the gold market is USD 8-10tr, Bitcoin is at 75bn. The only way for Bitcoin to reach a ‘market cap’ in the trillions of dollars is to be volatile.</p>
<p>The properties of gold is almost entirely inferior to crypto, except that gold has been around longer. Bitcoin and other crypto assets have low storage cost, small physical attack surface (with a ‘brain wallet’, Bitcoin is unhackable), it is divisible etc.</p>
<p>With time and wider acceptance, we expect the volatility to decrease substantially. Once this occurs, it will be able to be used as a unit of account and medium of exchange.</p>
<p>Regarding scalability, there are several solutions being worked on (and implemented) currently including:</p>
<p>● Lightning Network<br />
● Segwit</p>
<p>Just like the early internet was ‘not scalable’ (dial up, slow, little infrastructure), we have seen that these are issues are surmountable.</p>
<p><strong>Until now, Bitcoin’s only real use has been to facilitate illegal activities such as drug transactions, tax evasion, avoidance of capital controls, or money laundering. </strong></p>
<p>This is a false statement. In the early days of Bitcoin, Silk Road and other dark markets where active. These have mostly been shut down by regulators and the people behind these markets have faced the legal consequences of running these operations. Bitcoin is far from anonymous, much less so to than cash.</p>
<p>This is what DEA is saying:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-07/bitcoin-speculators-not-drug-dealers-dominate-crypto-use-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-07/bitcoin-speculators-not-drug-dealers-dominate-crypto-use-now </strong></a></p>
<p>UK Treasury rates Digital Currency risk for money laundering as ‘low’ (the traditional financial system pose a ‘high’ risk): <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/uk-treasury-digital-currencies-low-money-laundering-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>https://www.coindesk.com/uk-treasury-digital-currencies-low-money-laundering-risk </strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Since the invention of money thousands of years ago, there has never been a monetary system with hundreds of different currencies operating alongside one another. </strong></p>
<p>We agree with Roubini that there will like be one winner in the category for store of value, now it looks like Bitcoin has the highest probability.</p>
<p>What he misses is the point that although crypto assets are known as ‘cryptocurrencies’ they are not all intended to be used as currencies. As an example, Ethereum serves a specific use case as a platform for smart contracts; it’s ‘currency’ ‘ether’ is the fuel of that platform.</p>
<p>There are over 2,000 crypto assets, most of which will not have long term value. There are a lot of experiments going on, but only a limited amount of long term winners in the space.</p>
<p><strong>Worse, cryptocurrencies in general are based on a false premise. According to its promoters, Bitcoin has a steady-state supply of 21 million units, so it cannot be debased like fiat currencies. But that claim is clearly fraudulent, considering that it has already forked off into several branches and spin-offs: Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. </strong></p>
<p>Blockchains are based on open source code, the fact that the code can be replicated and new coins can be created doesn’t mean it’s inflationary. If I copy a USD bill in a photocopier, my copy will have no value. If I copy Bitcoin’s software and create ‘Bitcoin-Henrik’, likewise it will not have any value. We believe most of the forked coins will ultimately have very little value precisely because it is not just the technology that is valuable but the network of users.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s inflation is set in code for anyone to verify. We no longer have to trust central banks not to print more money, or make educated guesses about Gold’s future supply.</p>
<p><strong>Crypto-currencies instead have not and will never have the tools to pursue economic and financial stability. The few like Bitcoin whose supply is truly constrained by an arbitrary mathematical rule will never be able to stabilize recessions, deflations and financial crises; they will rather lead to permanent and pernicious deflation. While the rest – 99% &#8211; have an arbitrary supply generation mechanism that is worse than any fiat currency and, at the same time, will never be able to provide either economic or price or financial stability. They will rather be tools of massive financial instability if their use were to become widespread. </strong></p>
<p>This is a Keynesian argument that might or might not be true should the world switch to a currency based on ‘sound money’ or ‘hard money’. If Bitcoin really would be a threat for massive financial instability, Bitcoin would need to be in the tens of trillions of dollars &#8211; a huge success.</p>

<p><strong>Buterin’s inconsistent trinity: crypto is not scalable, is not decentralized, is not secure </strong></p>
<p>Roubini makes the assumption that this technology will not scale. Considering the number of people from tech giants, universities, etc who have joined the crypto industry in the past 5 years, this is likely a mistake.</p>
<p>Roubini doesn’t mention the ‘second layer’ approach that is very promising. Bitcoin’s Lightning Network could potentially handle millions of transactions per second &#8211; that is getting deployed right now. Dfinity is an example of a new blockchain using new cryptography that might be able to scale to thousands of transactions per second while still being decentralised. Many other projects are underway that are attempting to tackle this exact problem. To write off future innovations I believe is a mistake not unlike another economist, Paul Krugman, who in 1998 wrote off the Internet as a fancy fax machine: “By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s”.</p>
<p><strong>Given these massive security problems of crypto, the solutions to these severe security problems are all variants of going back to the stone age: do not put your long private key – that no human can memorize ever – on any digital device but rather write it down on a piece of paper and hide it in a hole where hopefully no one will find it or no insect or rat will destroy it. </strong></p>
<p>Custody of crypto assets is akin to securely store cash or gold. There are methods to safely store crypto assets using hardware wallets. For institutions, custody solutions are being built by some of the most trusted names in finance such as ICE (NYSE), Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and Nomura. If all these services already existed, the value of crypto assets would likely be much higher &#8211; the fact that custody has and still is a big barrier to entry is an opportunity &#8211; not a permanent problem that never will be solved.</p>
<p><strong>There are hundreds of stories of greedy crypto-criminals raising billions of dollars with scammy white papers that are nothing but vaporware and then literally stealing these billions to buy Lambos, expensive cars, villas in the Caribbean and the French Riviera. These large scale criminals stealing dozens of billions make the small and petty Wolf of New York robbing small investors in criminal penny stock manipulation schemes looks an amateur. </strong></p>
<p>It is true that the price bubble last year attracted many people that saw quick and easy money. With prices coming down, a regulatory clampdown from SEC and regulatory bodies around the world &#8211; we will hopefully see much less of that going forward.</p>
<p><strong>The main problem is any oligopolistic cartel will end up behaving like an oligopoly: using its market power to jack up prices, fees for transactions and increase its profit margins. Indeed, as concentration of mining has increased over the last year transaction costs of crypto – as measured by miners’ fees divided by number of transactions – have skyrocketed. </strong></p>
<p>This is factually incorrect. The below graph shows the miners’ fee divided by number of transactions, which has been declining all year:</p>

<p><strong>First, miners are massively centralized as the top four among them control three quarters of mining and behave like any oligopolist: jacking up transaction costs to increase their fat profit margins. And when it comes to security most of these miners are in non-transparent and authoritarian countries such as Russia and China. So we are supposed not to trust central banks or banks when it comes to financial transactions but rather a bunch of shady anonymous concentrated oligopolists in jurisdictions where there is little rule of law? </strong></p>
<p>The testimony gives an impression that Roubini believes the miners control Bitcoin. The miners influence of Bitcoin is in reality very restricted. All a miner can do while having less than 51% of the network (hash power), is mine empty blocks &#8211; a block without transactions or censor a transaction &#8211; both of which are not detrimental to the network. A single miner having more than 51% of the network could in theory do more damage. No Bitcoin miner is that large by a big margin and as Bitcoin and its hash power grows this type of attack wouldn’t make much sense. An attack would require 100s of millions of dollars for the chance of reversing a transaction and potentially be kicked out of the network making the initial investment obsolete. I.e. the miners are incentivised to keep the network secure, not compromise it.</p>
<p>Smaller cryptocurrencies using the same ‘mining algorithm’ could however be in danger and as Roubini points out we have seen attacks happen in these smaller coins.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth, wealth in crypto-land is more concentrated than in North Korea where the inequality Gini coefficient is 0.86 (it is 0.41 in the quite unequal US): the Gini coefficient for Bitcoin is an astonishing 0.88.</p>
<p></strong>This is also factually incorrect. According to DSHR’s blog: ‘The link is to Joe Weisenthal&#8217;s <em>How Bitcoin Is Like North Korea</em> from nearly five years ago, which was based upon a Stack Exchange post, which in turn was based upon a post by the owner of the Bitcoinica exchange from 2011! Which didn&#8217;t look at all holdings of Bitcoin, let alone the whole of crypto-land, but only at Bitcoinica&#8217;s customers!’</p>
<p>We have noted many of these studies include big wallets belonging to companies such as Coinbase and Binance &#8211; which in turns have hundreds of thousands of customers.</p>
<p><strong>Blockchain’s boosters would argue that its early days resemble the early days of the Internet, before it had commercial applications. But that comparison is simply false. Whereas the Internet quickly gave rise to email, the World Wide Web, and millions of viable commercial ventures used by billions of people in less than a decade, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin do not even fulfill their own stated purpose. </strong></p>
<p>We note that both TCP/IP one of the fundamental protocols for the Internet as well as email was invented in the early 70s and two decades later was still not widely used. A boost in usage was seen in the 90s as Marc Andreessen co-founded Mosaic, the first web browser. Bitcoin is not yet 10 years old. Marc Andreessen sees the similarities to the Internet and in 2014 published the now seminal article about Bitcoin in NYT: https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/</p>
<p>He is putting his money where is mouth is, the VC firm Marc Andreessen co-founded, a16z, a few months ago launch a USD 300M fund dedicated to crypto investments.</p>
<p><strong>Jay Clayton, the chairman of US Securities and Exchange Commission, recently made it clear that he regards all cryptocurrencies as securities, with the exception of the first mover, Bitcoin, which he considers a commodity. The implication is that even Ethereum and Ripple – the second- and third-largest crypto-assets – are currently operating as unregistered securities.</strong></p>
<p>This is an odd statement by Roubini as SEC has made it clear that Bitcoin and Ethereum specifically are not securities. One of the major criteria as outlined by the SEC for a crypto asset to fail the Howey Test (and not being regarded as a security) is to be sufficiently decentralised. As almost all ICOs are not decentralised &#8211; they are very likely securities under US securities regulation. Roubini is right that ICOs not complying with regulations are unlawful. We have already seen a big reduction in ICO investments and many of the more serious offerings are operating within security regulation and only open to accredited investors like ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>But now zealot supporters of crypto are pretending that this environmental disaster can be minimized or resolved soon. Since using millions of computers to do useless cryptographic games to secure the verification of crypto transactions is a useless waste of energy – as the same transactions could be reported at near zero energy costs on an single Excel spreadsheet&#8230; </strong></p>
<p>We would strongly argue that Bitcoin miners are not performing ‘useless’ games. Their work is necessary, a crucial ingredient in creating a trustless, permissionless ledger that is probabilistic immutable. Gold mining, the global financial system &#8211; all human activity consumes energy. Almost by definition the energy consumption reflects the usefulness, miners wouldn’t use all this energy if it wasn’t worth it and they got paid for it.</p>
<p>As for how green Bitcoin is, there any many different opinions, this is one from Bloomberg Crypto contributor Elaine Ou: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-12-07/bitcoin-is-greener-than-its-critics-think" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-12-07/bitcoin-is-greener-than-its-critics-think</a></p>
<p><strong>Blockchain is most overhyped technology ever, no better than a glorified spreadsheet or database </strong></p>
<p>We mostly agree with Roubini about Blockchain being overhyped. ‘Blockchain’ is not very well defined and it has come to represent no more than a glorified or shared database. We strongly believe the revolution lies in open blockchains that are trustless, where ‘trust’ is the new primitive for applications. We recently published an article on how Blockchain is indeed hyped: <a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2018/11/13/blockchain-vs-crypto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2018/11/13/blockchain-vs-crypto </a></p>
