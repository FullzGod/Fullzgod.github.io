										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching Apollo Capital in early 2018, we have kept a keen eye on the correlations between crypto assets and traditional assets. Crypto assets have had a unique path. They are the first asset class that has started with retail participants, slowly working their way up to institutional investors. Almost always, a new asset class will start with the privileged elite, slowly making its way down to retail investors, if ever. This unique path has led to an independence of crypto assets &#8211; they are independent, by their nature, from traditional assets. We have long suggested that this independence should, in theory, lead to a lower correlation in performance. The data has generally backed up this theory, but as is with most matters relating to crypto, it’s an evolving story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We last provided an update on crypto correlations in October 2020. In </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/crypto-correlations-post-coronavirus-panic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we showed that crypto correlations had increased significantly as a result of the March 2020 sell off across almost all asset classes. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto assets and equities are fundamentally different, but their recent correlation is a result of the ‘risk off’ attitude that was prevalent in the weeks following the initial market panic.</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thought it timely to re-run the data with a view to answering the question, do crypto assets correlate with traditional assets?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Data</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In calculating the correlations between crypto assets and traditional assets, we have used the Apollo Capital Fund’s monthly returns since inception on 1 February 2018. For traditional assets, we have used various Vanguard Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. All performance data is calculated in Australian dollars. To our increasingly global audience, we expect the key themes of this data will hold in different currencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If two assets are perfectly correlated, that is, their price action moves perfectly in sync, we can expect a correlation number of 1. If two assets are inversely correlated, that is, their price action moves in the exact opposite direction, we can expect a number of -1. If two assets are not correlated at all, we can expect a number of 0.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, using the same data, Australian Equities have a correlation of 0.79 to International Equities &#8211; they are not perfectly correlated, but they tend to move in tandem.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1392 aligncenter" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table-300x150.png" alt="" width="622" height="311" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table-300x150.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table-768x384.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see from the above table that crypto asset correlations have largely decreased since September 2020. The extra 16 data points (the months between Sep 2020 and Jan 2022) have seen crypto assets correlation to Australian Equities decrease from 0.39 to 0.26. International and US Equities have also decreased. At 0.26, we wouldn’t say that crypto assets are not correlated to Australian Equities, but we’d say they are largely uncorrelated. We could conclude that crypto assets are not correlated to Australian bonds, International Bonds and Gold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this mean that crypto assets are correlating even less to traditional assets? Unfortunately, we don’t think it’s that simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data in the table above is point to point &#8211; encapsulating all performance from 1 February 2018 to 31 January 2022. While we can draw valuable insights from a point to point comparison, it does not tell us anything about what happened along the way. It is also valuable to analyse rolling crypto correlations, how correlations have changed over a period of time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolling Correlations</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolling correlations are calculated by analysing performance data over a given length of time. As new data points become available, older data points drop off. For example, the twelve month rolling correlation on 31 January 2019 will only take into account performance data from 1 February 2018 to 31 January 2019. As we roll forward to 28 February 2019, the February data point in 2018 is discarded and updated with the February data point for 2019. We can perform this analysis for different rolling lengths of time, for example, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. We would expect a smoother result for longer periods of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start with the 24-month rolling period. The Equities Group is fairly smooth. Australian Equities starts at around 0.50 and over the past year has largely stayed around 0.20 &#8211; 0.25.  International Equities and US Equities are fairly consistent around 0.20. The correlation with gold displays a little volatility. Interestingly, the correlation with Bonds goes from reasonably positive to reasonably negative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1398 aligncenter" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3-300x185.png" alt="" width="628" height="387" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3-300x185.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3-1024x633.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3-768x474.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3.png 1533w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the point to point comparison and the 24-month rolling period are interesting, they can often smooth over interesting takeaways. Let’s take a look at the 12-month rolling correlation. (We have removed a number of the asset classes, otherwise it’s very hard to follow).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1394 aligncenter" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-Month-Rolling-Correlations-300x185.png" alt="" width="585" height="361" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-Month-Rolling-Correlations-300x185.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-Month-Rolling-Correlations-768x475.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-Month-Rolling-Correlations.png 786w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focussing on Australian Bonds and Australian Equities, we can see there is a larger degree of volatility in the correlations with crypto assets. Australian Bonds varies significantly, starting negative, before increasing to meaningfully positive, before decreasing to meaningfully negative. Australian Equities also shows a deal of volatility, as correlations increased after March 2020, before decreasing to meaningfully negative in mid 2021 and recently turning positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time we provided an update on correlations we concluded that in a ‘risk off’ environment, crypto assets were not spared. As equity markets began to price in the effects of Covid-19 in March 2020, crypto assets did as well. Equity markets then recovered, as did crypto markets. This appears to have been the case in recent months with interest rate hikes and market concerns over tapering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe there are two key takeaways from this analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Takeaway #1: crypto assets are not a short-term hedge</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To describe crypto assets as a hedge against equity markets is unrealistic. Equally, we don’t think it is appropriate to describe a young technology as a safe haven asset class. It is unrealistic to view crypto assets as a safe haven asset class as well as a technological innovation with enormous upside potential. We believe this description of a safe haven asset class has come about due to the comparison of Bitcoin and Gold going too far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have two strong data points now in March 2020 and in January 2022 clearly showing that crypto markets will not perform well if there is widespread sell off in other asset classes. Perhaps we thought it might be the case a number of years ago due to crypto&#8217;s independent nature, but it would be naive to expect it going forward.</span></p>
<p><strong>Takeaway #2: crypto assets are still largely uncorrelated to traditional assets </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see from both the table above and the 24-month rolling correlation graph that crypto assets, over a long period of time, are still largely uncorrelated to traditional assets. If anything, it appears crypto assets have become less correlated over the last two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between these two takeaways is timeframe. Over a short period of time, especially in a ‘risk off environment&#8217;, crypto assets will likely not perform well and correlation to equities in particular will increase. A simple explanation for this is in the ‘risk off environment:’ investors sell everything, including crypto assets, and move to cash and perhaps gold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over a longer period of time, we clearly demonstrate that crypto correlations are still relatively low. We believe this independence described in the opening paragraph still holds. Crypto assets are still largely independent from traditional assets. We believe an asset class with enormous potential and a low correlation to other assets is worth considering in the overall portfolio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this feeds back into our broader narrative at Apollo Capital: we believe there is a strong argument for a small allocation to crypto assets within the broader portfolio for long-term, patient investors. </span></p>

<p class="">We have always believed that there is a clear and strong case for investors to consider a small allocation to crypto assets in their portfolios.</p>
<p class="">There are a number of competing tensions investors need to balance. Crypto assets offer enormous return potential, mostly uncorrelated to traditional assets. However, they are not without risk. The asset class is still young and prices are highly volatile.</p>
<p class="">In balancing the risks and return potential, we believe a key consideration is position sizing. We have analysed the impact of various levels of allocations to crypto assets within the context of a broader portfolio. For the purposes of this analysis, an allocation to crypto assets means an investment in the Apollo Capital Fund.</p>
<p class="">We have simulated the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#8220;Base&#8221; portfolio of 60% Australian equities, 40% Australian bonds</li>
<li>2% crypto</li>
<li>5% crypto</li>
<li>10% crypto</li>
</ol>
<p>In allocating to crypto assets from these portfolios, we decrease equally the allocation to equities and bonds. For example, a 10% crypto allocation results in a portfolio of 55% equities, 35% bonds and 10% in the Apollo Capital Fund. We also note that a 10% allocation crypto is probably on the higher side of what many investors might consider.</p>
<p class="">We performed this analysis over a four year time frame, the same four years Apollo has been managing the Apollo Capital Fund. It is fascinating to analyse the effect on the portfolio at various points in time.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Scenario 1 &#8211; Poor Timing</strong></p>
<p class="">We launched the Apollo Capital Fund on 1 February 2018, the start of a severe 12 month bear market. Analysing the first year’s returns allows us to analyse the impact of highly negative crypto asset performance on the whole portfolio.</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">The Apollo Capital Fund was down around 68% between February 2018 and February 2019. The effect of different allocations on the overall portfolio is varied. A 2% allocation (the orange line), at the end of the first year, was a portfolio with a 0.9% return compared to a 3% return for the base portfolio. A 5% allocation (silver line) returned -1.8% and a 10% allocation (yellow line) was affected more significantly with a return of -6.3%. The lowest drawdown of the 10% crypto asset portfolio was -7.71% in November 2018 when the fund returned -33%.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Scenario 2 &#8211; Excellent Timing</strong></p>
<p class="">In Scenario 2, let’s assume an investor allocates to crypto assets through the Apollo Capital Fund with excellent timing on 1 February 2020. This analysis is straightforward &#8211; if we assume the timing is excellent, clearly a larger allocation to a high performing asset class will have a more positive impact on the overall portfolio.</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">Where this analysis is interesting is the magnitude of the impact on the overall portfolio, compared to the magnitude of the impact in Scenario 1.</p>
<p class="">A 2% allocation generated a return of 8.02% while the base portfolio returned around 3.60%. A 5% allocation returned 16.11% and a 10% allocation returned 27.53%.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Scenario 3 &#8211; Long Term</strong></p>
<p class="">The last time frame to analyse is the effect on the portfolio over a longer period of time, the four year period of the Apollo Capital Fund. This time frame includes both periods of severe drawdowns and periods of strong performance. It starts with Scenario 1 and ends with Scenario 2.</p>

<p class="">Overall the performance of the Apollo Capital Fund has been very strong over the last four years. The 10% allocation has performed well returning 50.16%, clear evidence of the strong return potential of crypto assets. The 2% allocation has made a material impact on the portfolio, returning 31.01% compared to 26.38% for the base portfolio. The 5% allocation returned 38.1%.</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps most notably, the 2% and 5% allocation delivered a material positive impact on the overall portfolio, but with minimal downside in Scenario 1.</p>

<p class="">By analysing the historical returns of an Australian portfolio consisting of equities, bonds and an allocation into the Apollo Capital Fund, we are able to see the potential benefits that crypto asset exposure can have on a traditional portfolio. During a bear market, a drawdown in crypto assets may not have a significant negative effect on the portfolio. During a bull market, the overall portfolio can benefit greatly. We describe this as crypto asset exposure offering traditional portfolios an asymmetrical return profile &#8211; the upside is much larger than the downside.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Hindsight</strong></p>
<p class="">It is important to remember that this analysis is performed with the benefit of perfect hindsight. While we remain bullish on crypto assets over a long period, it remains to be seen if we are the start of another Scenario 1, another Scenario 2 or something in between.</p>
<p class="">We think this analysis is important and helpful in quantifying the effect of crypto assets within a broader portfolio. Of course, future returns might be more negative or more positive, and may affect an overall portfolio more drastically. Investors’ portfolios vary, likely containing other assets and not just 60% Australian Equities and 60% Australian Bonds.</p>
<p class="">While all investors in the Apollo Capital Fund are optimistic crypto assets will continue to perform strongly, they need to be prepared and able to withstand the ups and downs along the way.</p>

<p class="">We believe there is a clear and strong case for investors to consider a small allocation to crypto assets in their portfolios.</p>
<p class="">There are a number of competing tensions for investors to balance. Crypto assets offer enormous return potential, mostly uncorrelated to traditional assets. However, they are not without risk. The asset class is still young and prices are highly volatile.</p>
<p class="">In balancing the risks and return potential, we believe a key consideration is position sizing. We have analysed the impact of various levels of allocation to crypto assets within the context of a broader portfolio. We have simulated three allocation levels: 2%, 5% and 10% and compared the performance to a base portfolio of 60% Australian equities, 40% Australian bonds. In allocating to crypto assets from these portfolios, we decrease equally the allocation to equities and bonds. For example, a 10% crypto allocation results in a portfolio of 55% equities, 35% bonds and 10% in the Apollo Capital Fund.</p>
<p class="">We performed this analysis over a three year time frame, the same three years Apollo has been managing the Apollo Capital Fund. It is fascinating to analyse the effect on the portfolio at various points in time.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Scenario 1 &#8211; Poor Timing</strong></p>
<p class="">We launched the Apollo Capital Fund on 1 February 2018, the start of a severe 12 month bear market. Analysing the first year’s returns allows us to analyse the impact of highly negative crypto asset performance on the whole portfolio.</p>

<p class="">The Apollo Capital Fund was down around 68% between February 2018 and February 2019. The effect of different allocations on the overall portfolio is varied. A 2% allocation (the orange line), at the end of the first year, was a portfolio with a 0.9% return compared to a 3% return for the base portfolio. A 5% allocation (silver line) returned -1.8% and a 10% allocation (yellow line) was affected more significantly with a return of -6.3%. The lowest drawdown of the 10% crypto asset portfolio was -7.71% in November 2018 when the fund returned -33%.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Scenario 2 &#8211; Excellent Timing</strong></p>
<p class="">In Scenario 2, let’s assume an investor allocates to crypto assets through the Apollo Capital Fund with excellent timing, as far as crypto assets are concerned on 1 February 2020. This analysis is straightforward &#8211; if we assume the timing is excellent, clearly a larger allocation to a high performing asset class will have a more positive impact on the overall portfolio.</p>

<p class="">Where this analysis is interesting is the magnitude of the impact on the overall portfolio, compared to the magnitude of the impact in Scenario 1.</p>
<p class="">A 2% allocation generated a return of 2.2% while the base portfolio returned around -1.6%. A 5% allocation returned 8.2% and a 10% allocation returned 18.7%.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Scenario 3 &#8211; Long Term</strong></p>
<p class="">The last time frame to analyse is the effect on the portfolio over a longer period of time, the three year period of the Apollo Capital Fund. This time frame includes both periods of severe drawdowns and periods of strong performance. It starts with Scenario 1 and ends with Scenario 2.</p>

<p class="">Periods of performance like this are not uncommon in crypto markets. But for new investors, what is the best strategy to allocate into these markets?</p>
<p class="">Before we put forward some thoughts, please let us be clear that this is not financial advice. Please do your own research and seek advice. We’re simply trying to conceptualise ways in which to allocate to a strong market.</p>
<p class="">Many new investors ask “how do you see markets performing over the next few months.” As much as people love to forecast, the only answer is “we don’t know.” Crypto markets are highly volatile and the market could just as easily ‘correct’ down 30% as it could jump another 100%.</p>
<p class="">We understand why investors ask this question. A new investment will be judged most harshly in its first months, particularly one in a volatile market such as crypto. A 30% correction is much easier to stomach after 2 years and +700% than it is after an initial allocation.</p>
<p class="">However, we must acknowledge that we don’t know the short term price fluctuations. Instead, we take a longer term view &#8211; new investors in crypto markets are still very early. We acknowledge that we’re in a bull market, we don’t think it’s over, but there will always be corrections and periods of consolidation.</p>
<p class="">If an investor accepts this starting point, the question then becomes one of timing. When is the best time to invest?</p>
<p class="">We believe we see a number of investors making mistakes with the timing of their investment decision. A common mistake we see is waiting for a pullback. We have spoken to a number of investors who are keen to allocate to crypto, but are “waiting for Bitcoin to retrace back to $30,000.” If an investor is keen to invest in crypto assets, we think this is a risky strategy. We know many investors that are still waiting for a pull back to $2,000. Now that might happen one day, but it’s becoming increasingly unlikely and increasingly painful for those investors.</p>
<p class="">We think a more prudent strategy is to carve an allocation into different tranches. If an investor has $100,000 to allocate to crypto markets, they could think about investing in crypto markets in say 3 or 4 tranches. Let’s say an investor chooses to invest across four tranches of $25,000. This strategy is commonly known as dollar cost averaging.</p>
<p class="">One strategy that we have seen is to make an initial allocation of $25,000, and at least <strong>get into the market</strong>. If an investor thinks a pull back to $30,000 is more likely than a jump to $100,000, it might still make sense to invest the initial tranche. If markets continue to increase, the initial allocation increases in value and the investor is up. If markets decrease, then it presents a buying opportunity to deploy further tranches. If Bitcoin and broader crypto assets end up retracing to $30,000, it might be an opportunity to deploy another one or two tranches.</p>
<p class="">Dollar cost averaging might seem like an overly simple strategy. It is often dismissed and ridiculed. Investors often like to think they can time their investments more strategically with the right amount of analysis and insight. Yet, as much as we humans like to think we can predict the future and time our investments to perfection, we think a more prudent strategy is to recognise our limitations.</p>
<p class="">We simply don’t know how crypto markets will perform over the short and medium term. Dollar cost averaging might be a prudent strategy in the highly volatile world of crypto assets, and make that initial allocation a little easier.</p>

<p class="">Investing in crypto assets is a fast paced job. Crypto markets move quickly and we are always on the lookout for new investment opportunities. With a wide array of investments, it is important to periodically pause and analyse how these investments have performed. Notably, it is important to analyse this at various levels, total fund performance, the performance of individual assets and the performance of the different verticals in which we invest.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1626320587214_246" class="">With the help of Apollo’s analyst Matthew Harcourt, co-author of this article, we have dug into the portfolio’s performance to analyse the attribution of these verticals.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Return Categories</strong></p>
<p class="">For the purpose of the this attribution analysis we are looking at four major contributors to our returns:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class=""><strong>Layer 1</strong>: base layer blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Typically we invest between 40-50% in layer one protocols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""><strong>Middleware</strong>: smart contract protocols built on top of one or multiple blockchains. Prominent assets include Maker, Numeraire, Synthetix. Typically we invest 40-50% in Middleware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""><strong>Primary Deals</strong> &#8211; new projects. Prominent assets include Algorand, Dfinity and Polkadot. Typically we invest 5-15% of the portfolio in Primary Deals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""><strong>Yield farming</strong> &#8211; a relatively new alpha generator which has performed exceptionally well of late. We explain yield farming in more detail below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class=""><strong>What is Yield Farming?</strong></p>
<p class="">At a basic level yield farming is locking up your cryptocurrency in order to earn a yield or rewards. You earn a yield because your locked capital is providing a service, the two main services you can provide with your capital is liquidity and lending. The fund currently has part of our holdings in Ethereum and Bitcoin as well as USD stablecoins locked up in multiple pools. Without yield farming these assets would be sitting idle.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Yield farming by providing liquidity to a decentralised exchange</strong></p>
<p class="">Decentralised exchanges (DEX) use liquidity pools to facilitate trade between users as they operate without a third party intermediary. A liquidity pool contains two or more assets and enables trading between them. The usage of a DEX incurs fees which are then paid out to the liquidity providers according to their share of the liquidity pool. The largest DEX, Uniswap, pays about $800,000 USD in fees to liquidity providers each day.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Curve DEX Example</strong></p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">Over the past 4 months the annualised yields available by providing liquidity have gone from under 50% to hundreds of percent and for brief periods in excess of thousands of percent. This is because projects have provided additional incentives in the form of governance tokens to attract liquidity into certain pools. In mid June, Compound was the first DeFi platform to successfully attract liquidity by distributing their governance token and this triggered hundreds of governance tokens to flood the market over the next few months.</p>
<p class="">As yield farming matures and investors learn to accurately value governance tokens, we anticipate annualised percentage yields will drop back down to sustainable levels.</p>
<p class="">Yield farming provides the fund with a source of income that will continue to have a positive impact on the portfolio regardless of crypto asset price action. Yield farming allows us to put ‘our funds to work’, particularly Ethereum and Bitcoin that would otherwise not be earning a yield. We also use stablecoins, tokens pegged to the USD to earn a high yield on these non-volatile assets. There is of course a small trade off here, as we accept higher risk associated with the smart contracts to which we contribute funds. We balance these risks against the potential increase in returns.</p>

<p class="">From January to the 31st of August the Apollo Capital Fund returned 203%. The clear driver of this return was the middleware asset category. The middleware assets that the fund holds are mostly related to Decentralised Finance (DeFi), the yield farming frenzy that occurred in June, July and August caused DeFi tokens to appreciate in price dramatically. The fund has been looking at financial applications on the blockchain since its inception and believes DeFi related middleware assets will continue to attract attention and capital.</p>
<p class="">Decentralised Finance protocol’s are mostly built on Ethereum. The growth in the fund’s layer 1 crypto assets is mostly attributed to the significant increase in the price of Ethereum. Bitcoin has remained relatively stable in comparison to both Ethereum and middleware assets.</p>

<p class="">The graph above is particularly interesting as we analyse the contribution of each vertical to monthly performance. As expected, middleware and layer 1 assets have the largest effect as they comprise the majority of the fund’s assets. The fund took full advantage of the yield farming frenzy throughout June, July and August with the passive income contributing significantly to the overall performance of the portfolio. Before June, the fund dedicated a very small amount of capital towards yield farming.</p>
<p class="">Primary assets mostly contributed very little to portfolio performance due to the small allocation and illiquid nature. However, August saw the primary asset Polkadot (DOT) surge in price as the project released their mainnet and the tokens became liquid. At its peak, Polkadot became a top 5 cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. We now consider Polkadot a layer 1 crypto asset.</p>
<p class="">Although it is not shown in the above graphs, crypto assets had an unsurprising correction in September. Throughout the month, yield farming continued to generate significant returns for the fund and was the only return category that positively contributed to the overall performance of the portfolio.</p>
<p class="">&#8212;</p>
<p class="">As is hopefully evident, Apollo Capital is committed to providing investors with transparent, clear information on all things crypto assets. We spend a great deal of our time thinking about how we can best communicate information about this complex asset class. We also recognise the need to provide transparent reporting on portfolio performance. We hope you enjoyed reading our attribution analysis and found it informative. We will keep investors updated as the fund progresses and as we keep up with the fast paced world of crypto assets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">Investors can invest in crypto assets in a number of ways. Historically, the only option has been a DIY approach. More recently, as institutions enter the market, structured investment options have appeared, including Apollo Capital.</p>
<p class="">We have analysed the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. While we won’t pretend our conclusion is not biased, we have tried to keep the analysis balanced. Hopefully this will help investors considering a DIY approach versus investing in Apollo Capital.</p>
<p class="">
__</p>
<p class="">Let’s start with the benefits of a DIY approach.</p>
<p class="">
<strong>Save on Fees</strong></p>
<p class="">This is the most obvious advantage to DIY investors. The Fund charges a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee, subject to a high watermark. A DIY investor saves these fees.</p>
<p class="">
<strong>Investment Approach</strong></p>
<p class="">The investment strategy of the Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Fund’s strategy offers exposure to broad crypto markets, including large liquid crypto assets, newer projects and a third bucket called opportunistic trading. An investor may prefer greater exposure to other parts of crypto markets. For example, an investor may prefer a portfolio dedicated to ICOs and new projects.</p>
<p class="">
<strong>DIY Advantages</strong></p>
<p class="">Many DIY investors simply prefer doing it themselves. Many investors like having control and flexibility of trading crypto in their own way. Typically these investors are heavily involved in monitoring crypto markets.</p>
<p class="">
<strong>Trust</strong></p>
<p class="">Trust is a big issue in crypto. Crypto assets are a major technological breakthrough in removing the need for a trusted third party as intermediaries. For example, Bitcoin removes the need for a trusted intermediary to move money from one person to another. Some investors may question the need to place trust in a Fund when they can hold crypto assets themselves. Some investors may question the trustworthiness of Apollo to hold crypto assets on behalf of our investors. I understand where these concerns come from. If I were objectively analysing a crypto Fund where I didn’t personally know the key executives involved, I would have the same concerns.</p>
<p class="">At Apollo, we try to do more than simply say ‘trust us.’ Contrary to the typical hedge fund, we are deliberately transparent with our operations and analysis of crypto markets. We release a weekly newsletter, monthly performance, quarterly market analysis, regular Webinar updates and we readily make ourselves available to investors and those wanting to learn more about crypto assets. We are publicly verifiable and we have staked our personal and professional reputations on Apollo Capital. We realise trust needs to be earned and that’s what we seek to accomplish. And we understand this may not be enough for some people that prefer to DIY.</p>
<p class="">The market infrastructure for investing in crypto will eventually mature to the point where this no longer becomes an issue. Just as investors don’t think twice about the level of trust or security involved in an equities Fund, we are confident crypto investments will mature to the same point. In time, we will see more crypto Funds with sophisticated and segregated approaches to custody, as well as a range of other crypto investment products like ETFs, indexed funds and listed derivatives. We like to think Apollo is helping pioneer the maturation of the asset class.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">__</p>
<p class="">Now to the advantages of investing in Apollo.</p>
<p class="">Rather than make this a blatant sales pitch, we’ll highlight some of the advantages of investing in the Fund that investors may not have considered.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Trading &amp; Execution</strong></p>
<p class="">Trading crypto assets starts by opening accounts at trusted crypto exchanges. First and foremost, this involves knowledge of the more reputable exchanges and avoiding those that are less trustworthy. Investors will need to pass AML/KYC checks for each exchange, transfer fiat currency and transfer crypto assets to cold storage once assets are purchased. To construct a diversified portfolio, investors will require accounts on various exchanges and will need to track crypto assets as they are transferred.</p>
<p class="">Unlike equities, trading crypto is not as simple as opening one brokerage account and gaining access to half the world’s listed securities.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p class="">Securing crypto assets is very difficult. While we mentioned above that trust in Apollo or our custody processes might be an impediment for some investors, we can easily flip this and say our security processes are almost certainly stronger than a DIY investor’s. All crypto investors (us included!) <strong>should not leave crypto assets on exchanges</strong>. Investors will need to source, configure and use a suitable cold storage device. Cold storage devices typically only offer support to a limited range of crypto assets, so multiple solutions will be needed for a diversified portfolio. Lastly, DIY investors should consider a <strong>disaster recovery plan</strong>. If they are hit by the proverbial bus or if something goes wrong, are their assets recoverable, including by their estate? In December last year, one of Canada’s largest crypto exchanges went <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/quadrigacx-users-lose-190m-as-speculations-over-cottens-death-swirl">down with $190m in customers’ funds</a> due to the death of the founder and CEO. He was the only one with access to the assets.</p>
<p class="">Storing and securing crypto assets is complex and technical. Investors must invest a great deal of time and energy to securing their assets properly.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Reporting &amp; Tax</strong></p>
<p class="">Reporting and accounting for crypto transaction is straightforward for a simple portfolio of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Trading a range of crypto assets is significantly more difficult, like trading a range of foreign currencies. Transactions from one currency to another, to another and back to the original all must be reported and accounted. Crypto is far more complicated as trades are usually into Bitcoin or Ethereum, then into another asset, then into another asset and back to Bitcoin or Ethereum and maybe back in to Australian Dollars. Unfortunately, investors cannot simply declare gains or losses back into Australia Dollars. Every trade must be accounted for with a corresponding gain or loss.</p>
<p class="">There is an economies of scale benefit to investing in Apollo. Our third party administrator performs these calculations for the benefit of all investors.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Alpha</strong></p>
<p class="">The biggest and yet most overlooked advantage to investing in Apollo is Alpha. As well as our expertise in crypto assets, we have two people constantly monitoring crypto markets. This is very hard for a DIY investor. While we admit that effort does not always equal results, over the 18 months we have been operating, net of fees, we have outperformed our benchmarks C20 ( an index Fund) and the Eurekahedge Cryptocurrency Hedge Fund Index (an index of our peers).</p>
<p class="">One key advantage we have over DIY investors is access. Our growing size and network in crypto communities means we have access to investment opportunities that many DIY crypto investors wouldn’t have even heard about, let alone gain access to.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Fatigue</strong></p>
<p class="">Lastly, it should be mentioned that a number of seasoned DIY crypto investors are tired of following crypto markets. Crypto markets are fast paced, evolving quickly and it takes a great deal of energy to keep up. While we know a number of investors that have retired from fatigue, we can’t get enough of crypto markets, we love it!</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">__</p>
<p class="">Whether it’s through the Apollo Capital Fund or a DIY investment approach, the most important issue is that all investors consider an investment in crypto assets. Crypto assets are a groundbreaking technology with enormous return potential that show little correlation to traditional assets.</p>
<p class="">Investors would be foolish to ignore them.</p>

<p class=""><em>One of our predictions for 2020 is the rise of the DAO. A DAO or Decentralised Autonomous Organisation is a way to organise people in a decentralised system like Ethereum by using tokens to vote. If we want to build decentralised systems, backing them with a DAO instead of a corporate entity or a foundation seem to us to be a more trustless and permissionless way to achieve the same functions as other organisational structures (see our </em><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2019/11/19/investment-highlight-synthetix" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>interview</em></a><em> with Kain from Synthetix on their move to a DAO structure). DAOs are still experimental and it is not clear how all decisions taken by a DAO can be implemented in a trust-minimised way.</em></p>
<p class="">DigixDAO was one of the early ICOs. In 2016 they raised 466,648 ETH, at the time worth $7 million. Digix proceeded to launch a gold pegged stablecoin called DGX backed by physical gold stored in audited vaults in Singapore. The DAO was used for community members to vote on projects that can support the growth of the gold pegged stablecoin. The DAO was controlled by the DGD token. DGD token holders participated in the governance of the DAO by staking tokens. In return they received transaction fees that were collected every time someone moved DGX tokens on the Ethereum network.</p>
<p class="">With less than $US6 million worth of gold outstanding the yield received by DGD stakers was painfully small compared to the value of the assets in the DAO. As the price of ether appreciated since the ICO, the $7M funding had by the end of 2019 grown to about US$64M of funds.</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">By not finding worthwhile projects to spend the money in the DAO on, that big war chest moved from being working capital for building an ecosystem to a big asset potentially directly available to DGD token holders.</p>
<p class="">In August of 2019 there was a proposal for DGD holders to be able to access the ETH in DigixDAO by redeeming their DGD. This proposal ultimately didn’t get enough support but it showed that it was possible to access the funds and the race was on.</p>
<p class="">By the end of November, the discussion about returning the funds to investors had heated up. The DGD token still traded at less than half the value of the assets in the DAO when project <a href="https://community.digix.global/#/proposals/0xe7d5d8aefc5f73c4c8bbc716f0c3c2dd52d5282d18217db331da4435b8e6966e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragnarok</a> was revealed. It would mean a full dissolution of the DAO where all ETH were to be returned to DGD holders. To us, the risk/reward looked favourable and we took a position in the DGD token.</p>
<p class="">In January 2020 as the voting got started, it fairly quickly became clear that DGD token holders saw more value in returning the ETH than continuing using the funds to build the DGD ecosystem. DigixDAO thus became the first ‘activist’ DAO trade.</p>

<p class="">Let’s unpack this sentence. We are:</p>
<p class="">1. “Investing in the crypto assets that are powering the <strong>next generation of computing</strong> infrastructure”</p>
<p class="">This is a new generation of computing. Specifically this new type of computing is replacing trusted third-parties with software. We can now do ownership and transfer of value (money, collectibles), participation and execution of smart contracts solely based on open source software not associated with a company or organisation. Software is both replacing rent seeking middlemen and enabling completely new use cases.</p>
<p class="">2. “Investing in the crypto assets that are powering the next generation of computing <strong>infrastructure</strong>”</p>
<p class="">We think it makes sense as investors to focus on infrastructure investments when the potential applications are not yet clear. By investing in infrastructure we are exposed to any possible application being built on top of that ecosystem’s critical infrastructure.</p>
<p class="">Not only do we believe infrastructure is a good starting point at the beginning of a new paradigm, our thesis is that most of the value will be captured in the lower parts of this new technology stack, specifically in what is known as base layer 1 Blockchains and Middleware:</p>

<p class="">Base layer 1 blockchains are their own chains like Bitcoin or Ethereum while middleware typically are smart contract protocols being built on top of one or multiple blockchains.</p>
<p class="">Our portfolio is balanced between layer 1 and middleware.</p>

<p class="">Our investment thesis is that Blockchains and certain Middleware are enabled by crypto assets, these are critical for this new software system. These crypto assets are where the majority of value is captured in this new paradigm. Another way of putting it — crypto assets are the fuel for this new type of software.</p>
<h2><strong>Verticals </strong></h2>
<p class="">We believe that there are two broad categories of applications for open blockchains: financial applications and non-financial applications. As we map out the Potential Value Capture vs. the Maturity of certain applications we end up with this picture:</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">We are convinced that the biggest potential value capture by crypto assets on open blockchains are related to financial applications. One reason why this is the case is that blockchains are only able to secure native blockchain assets and smart contracts related to those assets. Non-native blockchain assets like identity will be hard to secure using open blockchains. Furthermore, anchoring non-native blockchain assets like identity doesn’t necessary capture a lot of value in crypto assets. In many cases non financial use cases end up anchoring information (e.g. through a hash) to a secure blockchain like Bitcoin. This can be done relatively cheaply using only a nominal amount of bitcoin.</p>
<p class="">For these reasons, financial related verticals and the crypto assets underpinning these verticals are our investment focus at Apollo Capital, specifically:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Store of Value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Privacy Coins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Stablecoins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Open Financial System</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="">These financial verticals will create an infrastructure layer for financial primitives that are:</p>
<p class="">1. Permissionless — accessible to anyone. Just like the Internet made the world’s information accessible to everyone with a smartphone, open blockchains will make financial infrastructure available to everyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. And just like the Internet broke down the barrier for publishing information on the Internet, anyone will be able to create financial instruments by interacting with smart contracts.</p>
<p class="">2. Trustless — not dependent on a third-party but on auditable software. Just like the information on Wikipedia is not dependent on one third-party actor but a network of contributors, the financial infrastructure of the future will not be dependent on a single vulnerable actor like a bank, state or financial institution.</p>
<p class="">3. Censorship resistant — financial freedom. The Internet is hard to censor, in the future our financial system will be hard to censor as the Open Financial System is borderless in nature and not tethered to geographical jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="">Once the basic layer is built, composability of these building blocks will lead to more advanced financial primitives to emerge and finally to user interfaces through web and mobile applications.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Store of Value</strong></p>
<p class="">Bitcoin as a potential store of value and unseizable asset not relying on a government is material. Gold and offshore accounts today account for tens of trillions in value. Properties of crypto assets such as Bitcoin are on many accounts better than our current versions. In addition crypto assets are programmable which opens up new avenues for innovation not possible with a physical commodity such as gold. Store of value doesn’t exclude other use cases such as payments, but in our view volatility needs to decrease before a store of value enters the real competition for other properties of money such as medium of exchange and unit of account.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Medium of Exchange</strong></p>
<p class="">In this category we mainly have stablecoins and privacy coins. Stablecoins suffer from a trilemma trying to optimise on scalability, stability and decentralisation. This is a hard problem to solve but where we see a lot of innovation. There is massive potential in the coming decade for stablecoins that can get this equation right. It is likely that in the very long term stablecoins will find competition from more pure crypto assets not tied to a peg once the volatility of those assets starts declining.</p>
<p class="">Privacy coins enable private transactions to take place and is an interesting and fast evolving vertical besides cryptocurrencies running an open transaction graph. As privacy coins tend to be innovative using newly developed cryptography, there is generally a higher technology risk in this vertical versus non privacy enabled coins.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Open Financial System</strong></p>
<p class="">This is a general term referring to a new financial system being built on top of open blockchains. The first financial primitives being built include:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Lending — being able to earn an interest rate on assets that you already hold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Credit markets — borrow against assets that you hold in your portfolio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Prediction and oracles — create a trustless source of truth for events outside blockchains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Derivatives — a leverage bet on an underlying asset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Decentralised exchanges —blockchain based trading without giving up custody of your assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Synthetic assets — blockchain assets that can trustlessly replicate non-blockchain assets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="">While many of the above primitives are still experimental in nature, it is easy to see them in the future vastly outcompete traditional solutions at least in certain categories and circumstances. As an example, taking out a loan on a blockchain can be as easy as a few clicks on a web 3 enabled browser.</p>
<p class="">Running financial services on software instead of relying on trusted financial institutions not only opens up access but could lead to substantial gains in productivity as the financial sector in many countries makes up a very substantial part of the GDP.</p>
<p class="">Core to our thesis is that the financial infrastructure being built on open blockchains will become a common utility not unlike the Internet itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">Our edge at Apollo Capital is our experience in both traditional financial markets and crypto markets. On a daily basis, Henrik and I draw upon our experience from traditional markets to construct a portfolio of crypto assets. Combined with our knowledge of crypto assets, we are the best in the country, if not further afield, at managing a crypto portfolio.</p>
<p class="">While I don’t pretend to know as much about crypto or financial markets as Henrik, my experience* is different and has undoubtedly shaped the way I approach crypto funds management.  I thought it timely to share a few thoughts on investing in crypto, in particular volatility, opportunity &amp; position sizing.</p>
<p class="">(*for more information on my background, please feel free to visit <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-johnston-au/">my LinkedIn page.</a>)</p>
<h2>1. Volatility</h2>
<p class="">A number of traditional financial ratios and models use volatility as a measure of risk. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), developed by Harry Markowitz in 1952, is used to optimise portfolios based on their expected returns and observed risk. The standard deviation of an asset’s returns is used as standardised measure of risk. MPT, CAPM, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratios, nearly every ratio I have come across uses volatility as a unit of risk.</p>
<p class="">The general theory is that the more volatile the asset, the higher the standard deviation of returns, the riskier the asset. <strong>The words volatile and risky have almost become interchangeable </strong>in financial markets.</p>
<p class="">If we put crypto through these models, I suspect the models would spontaneously combust. Crypto is extremely volatile. I usually check crypto prices a couple of times a day and it is common to see 24hr price swings of greater than 10%. Imagine if that were the case in equity markets! Throughout the 16 months since inception, the Apollo Capital Fund has already delivered monthly returns ranging from +45% to -34%.</p>
<p class="">In Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s 2007 annual meeting, <strong>Warren Buffett said the following about volatility and risk</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">“It&#8217;s nice, it&#8217;s mathematical, and wrong. Volatility is not risk. Those who have written about risk don&#8217;t know how to measure risk. Past volatility does not measure risk. When farm prices crashed, [farm price] volatility went up, but a farm priced at $600 per acre that was formerly $2,000 per acre isn&#8217;t riskier because it&#8217;s more volatile.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">Instead, Buffett prefers the dictionary definition of risk: “risk is the possibility of loss or injury.”</p>
<p class="">Why is crypto risky?</p>
<p class="">It is clear that investing in crypto is risky: there is a possibility of loss (hopefully not injury!) and that <strong>possibility exists because crypto is young and the future is uncertain</strong>. Any groundbreaking technology is going to be met by opposing camps of skepticism and fervour. Crypto is a complex topic and it’s future is anything but clear. It is easy to forget, but many people thought the same about internet stocks in the mid 90s &#8211; they were risky investments.</p>
<p class="">Why is crypto volatile?</p>
<p class=""><strong>Crypto is volatile for two reasons</strong>: it is risky and prices are retail driven.</p>
<p class="">Crypto prices are predominantly retail driven. Retail investors are more easily caught up in the waves of greed and fear that drive financial markets, especially crypto markets. While the equities that represented the internet hysteria were certainly volatile, they were not as retail driven as crypto markets. Crypto assets are more accessible to the world’s population than equities on listed stock exchanges and equity markets are largely driven by institutional capital.</p>
<p class="">The distinction between risk and volatility is important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">“Crypto is not risky because it is volatile. Crypto is volatile because it is risky”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">Once we accept this important distinction, <strong>the solution to deal with the risk is clear: position sizing</strong>.</p>
<p class="">Position sizing refers to allocation of capital to a particular investment in the context of the overall portfolio. For us as managers of the Fund, we discuss the size of positions such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Do we invest 10%, 20% or 40% of the portfolio in Bitcoin? For the individual investor, position sizing refers to the amount of capital allocated to crypto relative to the overall portfolio.</p>
<p class="">Although we do not provide advice to investors in the Fund, we certainly do not advocate investing 50% of a portfolio in crypto, it’s too risky. The possibility of loss is too great and the consequences of any loss too severe. Many of the greatest thinkers in crypto suggest allocating an amount of capital that the investor is prepared to lose. Studies of institutional investors in crypto suggest starting allocations of 0.2% to 0.3%. Crypto is risky and for any investment in crypto there is a possibility of loss of capital.</p>
<h2>2. Opportunity</h2>
<p class="">I used to work at a funds management company that managed more than $500m of client funds in Australian equities. My former boss, a veteran investor with more than 30 years experience across a range of markets, taught me a number of lessons about investing. One of the key lessons that stuck with me is “<strong>the best returns often come from the ones you feel uneasy about.</strong>” I didn’t realise it at the time, but I now understand why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">“Risk creates opportunity”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">When a company’s future is uncertain, when the risk feels high, other investors often reach similar conclusions, many choosing to avoid that risk by either selling or not investing. Risk can create opportunities to buy assets that are cheap. It is the job of the investor to discern from risky opportunities that are worth investing in, compared to those that are doomed to fail.</p>
<p class="">I see similar circumstances to crypto assets. There are numerous reasons why crypto assets may not succeed. Investing in crypto is risky. This creates opportunity. One of the main reasons for this uncertainty is a lack of understanding. The vast majority of people have not or will not spend a little time trying to understand crypto. This is a missed opportunity to learn about a technology with enormous disruptive and innovative potential.</p>
<p class=""><strong>This creates opportunity for those that have a keener understanding of crypto</strong>. It is interesting at this point to stop and consider, “how much do I need to understand to make an investment in crypto?” An investor doesn’t need a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies of crypto assets to make an investment. Just as we don’t need to understand the code behind Google’s search algorithms, we don’t need to understand the of code that powers the Bitcoin network. A more relevant understanding is the power of Google’s search algorithms to its users, the power of the Bitcoin network to its users and why both are better than the alternatives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">“Investors need to understand the three forces driving crypto innovation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">First, it is a groundbreaking technology. We have written at length how crypto removes the need for trusted intermediaries and the resulting waves of disruptive innovation. Second, it has attracted huge amounts of capital. Third, the world’s best computer software engineers are flocking to work on challenging crypto projects. Understanding the power of innovation that is likely to come from these forces is more important than knowing the details of the Ethereum code.</p>
<p class="">For those that see the potential, for those that read Apollo Capital’s weekly newsletter and understand why crypto shows promise, investing a small amount in crypto is obvious. Investors realise the inherent risks in these investments, but they accept these risks and in doing so, give themselves a chance of capturing the upside.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Again, we come back to position sizing.</strong> The future of crypto is uncertain and accordingly, it makes most sense to only invest a small percentage of the portfolio in crypto assets. Despite working in crypto and understanding crypto assets better than most, I only have a small percentage of my net worth in crypto. I have a far, far greater percentage in my house, despite having greater conviction in crypto than the property market in Australia.</p>
<p class="">&#8212;</p>
<p class="">An unfounded fear of volatility and a lack of understanding is causing the majority of investors to miss out on the crypto opportunity. Many are waiting to understand crypto in full, or for there to be greater understanding from their peers and the media. They are missing the point. By the time this happens, the market capitalisation of crypto assets will be in the trillions.</p>
<p class="">Once crypto becomes mainstream and well understood, the opportunity will be long gone, leaving many investors to regret the omission of a small allocation in their portfolio.</p>
<p class="">**please note this article does not constitute financial advice. My thoughts are my own.</p>

<p>For entrepreneurs this is great news, anyone can build on top of a platform like Ethereum, that’s the power of a permissionless blockchain. They are not restricted by the terms of services for an app store and they don’t have to give away a substantial part of their revenues to a third party. For the users, the benefits are security (centralised databases sooner or later gets hacked), ownership of data and identity and the freedom to move your data between the coming ecosystem of decentralised apps, or ‘dApps’.</p>
<p>Another way to think about this transition is to look at the value capture in this transition. Union Square in 2016 published the now famous <a href="http://www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘Fat Protocol’ hypothesis</a>. This is our simplified version of the fat protocol:</p>

<p>The idea is that value is following the data, so when we move to a decentralised world where blockchains are the new protocols for data and value — that is also where most of the value will be captured. We will have a massive ecosystem of application on top of these new protocols, but that’s not where the majority of the value will accrue.</p>
<p>We would like to add to this picture by stating that Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 will still be present alongside Web 3.0. Just like we have some mostly static informational web sites today reminiscent of Web 1.0, as we move to a more decentralised web, today’s most popular services will likely still exist. Facebook and Twitter will very likely still be present on the web for a long time still, and they are likely to continue to capture substantial value even in the future. We are indeed perhaps not primarily decentralising the current web. Instead blockchain technology enables a much bigger web through human and machine interactions that simply wasn’t possible before.</p>
<p>Apollo’s vision of the future is therefore a much bigger web that can capture more value than ever before:</p>

<p>Thanks to blockchain technology, we can now add substantial value to the current web, we believe mostly along three lines:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>Digital Ownership. Blockchain technology makes digital ownership possible. Be it of money, data, identity or digital goods.</li>
<li>Smart Contracts. With smart contracts an open financial system will be built and available to anyone in the world. Borrowing, lending, derivatives and the democratisation of fund raising. A longer term vision encompasses the rise of decentralised autonomous organisations or ‘DAOs’.</li>
<li>Tokenisation of Everything. I’ve <a href="https://medium.com/apollo-capital/the-future-tokenisation-of-everything-part-1-b21d6ca3a8eb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously written</a> on this topic and how real estate, hedge fund and VC interest will be tokenised and then later today’s liquid assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarise, Web 3.0 is less about the coming disruption of Facebook, Twitter and Uber and more about enabling new forms of value capture, uniquely enabled by blockchain technology. This is the exciting future we invest in and the reason we are so passionate about our mission at Apollo Capital.</p>
