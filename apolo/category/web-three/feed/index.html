										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket Network is quickly establishing itself as a core part of Crypto and Web3 infrastructure. Before Pocket Network, the builders of decentralised applications (dApps) and wallet providers had no choice but to use centralised providers for critical infrastructure services. The infrastructure service that Pocket Network provides can simply be described as ‘fetching real-time data from a blockchain’. DApps, users, and wallet providers can now opt out of using a centralised provider like Infura for this real-time data and instead use Pocket Network’s decentralised network of node operators. The benefits of this decentralised alternative will be explained throughout this post. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Centralisation Problem</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As active investors in crypto assets, we are constantly looking for decentralised solutions to the problems that centralisation can cause. The current sector, Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), has been dominated by a centralised entity called Infura for the past five years and is ripe for disruption. Infura, a subsidiary of the blockchain technology solutions conglomerate ConsenSys, provides developers with the tools and infrastructure to alleviate the burden of running their own ‘data feeding’ tools so that they can instead focus on building their applications. The most popular crypto asset wallet, Metamask, is another product in ConsenSys’ product suite. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Infura has played a vital role in enabling the development and function of DAaps on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms, it has encountered several issues over the past 24 months. These issues include several outages due to the increasing demand for bandwidth across blockchain ecosystems, and their involvement in censoring certain users from accessing their Metamask wallets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2020, Infura lagged behind the rest of the Ethereum node network by not updating to the latest node client and subsequently suffered a significant outage. This shouldn’t have even come close to impacting the wider network; however, because of Infra’s scale and importance, the event </span><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/84232/ethereum-infrastructure-provider-infura-is-down"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caused the Ethereum blockchain to fork</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a result, forked exchanges halted deposits/withdrawals, and the popular wallet, MetaMask, could not be used. While the issue was resolved without any lasting problems, it highlighted some of the issues surrounding Ethereum’s overdependence on large centralised infrastructure services providers such as Infura. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infura and Metamask also came under fire in March of this year when they accidentally blocked Venezuelan users from accessing their digital wallets. The outage of these wallets occurred when Infura changed specific settings too broadly by applying certain geoblocks after the US had announced new sanctions due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The Venezuelan geoblocks were accidentally included in these setting updates leaving many Venezuelan users locked out of their digital wallets. Events like these draw attention to the flaws of a centralised service provider and the tremendous power that Infura possesses in the IaaS market. We believe dAaps and their smart contract builders will elect to utilise products that can offer 100% uptime and censorship-resistant solutions within the IaaS space. These are two features that are core to Pocket Network’s value proposition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Pocket Network Explainer</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket Network is a blockchain data ecosystem for Web3 applications. It is a platform built for applications that use cost effective economies to coordinate and distribute data at scale. Today, the Pocket Network distributes data feeds to numerous dApps across 40 networks, including Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Algorand, and Harmony. These data feeds are vital to the functionality of the dApps. They include any relevant information on a blockchain a certain dApp may require. For example, MyCrypto, a crypto asset wallet provider, will use Pocket Network to retrieve token prices, ticker symbols, contract addresses, gas prices, and other data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket Network’s tokenomics and consensus mechanisms are based on a Proof-of-Stake model, ensuring the data it relays is decentralised, and node operators are sufficiently incentivised. Today it has approximately 40,000+ nodes, which compute an average of 3 billion weekly relays to dApps across 40 networks seamlessly and securely. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Apollo Investment</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the fork caused by Infura in November 2020, we first spoke with Pocket Network Co-Founder and CEO, Michael O’Rourke, in January 2021. At that time, the network had averaged 23.25 million relays each week for the previous month and there were less than 1000 nodes on the network. In contrast, Infura was processing around 2 billion relays/API calls per day. Pocket Network had been quietly in development for over three years before we first spoke to the team. On the surface, it was hard to see the progress made over these 3 years due to the relatively low relays/API calls. However, after digging deeper, it was clear to us that Pocket Network had the potential to really shake up the sector. In February 2021, we proceeded to buy POKT tokens directly from the Pocket Network team for US$0.12 each, subject to a 12-month lock-up. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1407 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-1024x683.png" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-300x200.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-768x512.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays-600x400.png 600w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/daily-relays.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following our investment, Pocket Network continued to be relatively underutilised and not very well known for a number of months. However, the network started to see increased traction and utilisation in Q4 2021 as the team added support for alternative Layer 1 chains such as Solana, Avalanche, Algorand and </span><a href="https://docs.pokt.network/home/resources/references/supported-blockchains"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the four weeks from 22-2-2022 to 24-3-2022, the Pocket Network averaged 1.738 billion relays per week with 37,820 nodes participating in the network. This represents a 74.75 times increase in weekly relays from 14 months earlier.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the middle of January 2022, the POKT token began trading on popular centralised exchanges; naturally this added to the excitement and hype surrounding the protocol. While the price chart below may not look favourable, the current valuation of POKT is an impressive US$918 million and significantly higher than our US$0.12 entry price. After seeing the network gain a level of traction, we directly purchased an additional tranche of POKT in December 2021 and began setting up staked nodes to increase our support for the network. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1409 size-large" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-1024x862.png" alt="" width="750" height="631" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-1024x862.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-300x253.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1-768x647.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chart-1.png 1179w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Apollo Node Operations </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operating a Pocket Network node requires a certain amount of POKT to be staked and a reasonable level of maintenance even with automation. In return for operating these nodes, we are rewarded with additional POKT in the form of both inflationary rewards and rewards driven by underlying network activity. Inflationary rewards refers to newly minted POKT; this increases the circulating supply of POKT and can have a negative impact on price if demand remains equal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our nodes currently represent 0.41% of the total network, this strategy is estimated to be generating a variable yield of around 100% APR on our total POKT staked. Apart from the minimum capital requirements, the main barrier to entry for running a node is the actual setting up of the nodes. We have leaned on the expertise of our in-house developer to activate and maintain these nodes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apollo Capital is proud to be supporting the Pocket Network as early investors and node runners. We are strong believers in the power of decentralisation and view Pocket Network as the key piece of the Web3 infrastructure required for blockchains to take another step towards complete decentralisation.   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Crypto Glossary Terms</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like in traditional finance, there is no shortage of crypto jargon that can make the average crypto newbie feel confused. Today we wanted to help define a few of these crypto native terms to educate readers. Unlike in the movie “The Big Short”, we were unfortunately unable to obtain A-list celebrities to explain these terms in exotic places.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Crypto Finance Terms</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMM &#8211; Automated Market Maker</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMM’s allow digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way by using liquidity pools rather than a &#8216;traditional market of &#8220;asks and bids&#8221;. AMM users supply liquidity pools with crypto assets. Other users can then enter those liquidity pools and swap one asset for another.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridging</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving crypto assets from one blockchain to another. This process usually involves locking the crypto asset on the original chain and then minting the equivalent on the destination chain. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CeFi</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centralised Finance &#8211; Refers to crypto finance that relies on third party intermediaries to function e.g. centralised exchanges and centralised lending platforms like BlockFi &amp; Nexo</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeFi </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralised Finance &#8211; Refers to a subset of crypto projects that aim to build financial applications on top of blockchains using smart contracts </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDP &#8211; Collateralised Debt Position</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CDP is created when an asset is borrowed (on Aave/ Compound) or minted (DAI, MIM) against funds locked in a smart contract. The value of the locked funds must be greater than the debt position.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flippening</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term ‘Flippening’ is given to a crypto asset that surpasses another crypto asset in market capitalisation terms. ‘Flippening’ is most commonly used to anticipate Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin in market capitalisation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas is the common term given to the amount of a native token used on smart contract platforms to buy and sell goods and services. Gas costs can be variable depending on the demand for the smart contract platform. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICO / IDO / IEO</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Initial DEX Offering (IDO) and Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) are names given to public fundraising rounds. They are the final round of raising a project team will perform before releasing their token to the market. ICOs are typically conducted privately with whitelisting of investors, whereas an IEO takes place on a centralised exchange and an IDO, on a permissionless decentralised exchange (DEX).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impermanent Loss (IL)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impermanent loss can occur when providing liquidity to an Automated Market Maker (AMM) due to the constant product function that liquidity pools utilise. As prices fluctuate, the total balance of each asset in the pool also changes, resulting in liquidity providers owning a different balance of coins compared to what they initially deposited. Impermanent loss is when this change in balance results in less returns than what could be achieved if the users just held the assets. It is “impermanent” because IL is mitigated if prices return back to what they were when the assets were deposited. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liquidity Pool</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Liquidity pool can be thought of as a pot of cryptocurrency assets locked within a smart contract, which can be used for exchanges, loans and other applications.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crypto-native derivative contract pioneered by crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX. This contract uses an intra-day funding rate to push the derivative price towards the spot price. Long and short traders either pay the funding rate or get paid the funding rate depending on the difference between the spot price and the derivative’s price.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play-to-Earn (P2E)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play-to-Earn (P2E) refers to the concept of gaming in which a platform provides its players the chance to earn any form of in-game assets that can be transferred to crypto assets or liquidated into fiat as a tangible asset. Play-to-Earn was made most famous by the well-known blockchain game &#8216;Axie Infinity&#8217;. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slippage </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between the current/expected price of a trade and the executed price of a trade. Slippage can be a significant problem for AMM liquidity pools pool with low liquidity. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Funding Trade</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding trade is a derivatives strategy to take advantage of the Perpetual Future&#8217;s funding rate. Usually, this strategy involves shorting the Perpetual Future while holding the equivalent amount in spot in order to collect the funding rate paid by long traders of the Perpetual Future. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TradFi </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional Finance &#8211; Refers to legacy financial infrastructure and institutions such as Banks.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitelisting</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitelisting is the act of reserving the right to participate in a crypto investments or minting of an NFT for particular crypto addresses. The owners of these addresses may be required to perform certain activities such as KYC, answer questionnaires and promote projects on social media to achieve the whitelisting. Similar to a ‘Cap Table’ in traditional finance, a list of whitelisted addresses will be the addresses guaranteed an investment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yield Farming</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yield farming involves locking capital into DeFi smart contracts in order to earn yield in the form of fees/interest and governance tokens. Check out our report</span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Yield-in-Crypto-Report.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Yield in Crypto&#8217;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The floor price is the lowest ask price for a given collection e.g. the lowest price you can instantly buy a </span><a href="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bored Ape Yacht Club</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BAYC) for. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Floor Sweeping</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Floor sweeping refers to the act of buying multiple lowest ask price NFTs in a given collection e.g. buying the 3 lowest ask price BAYC’s.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fork </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fork occurs when the rules of a blockchain are changed, possibly creating two (or more) distinct digital assets. This may result from an upgrade to the features of the blockchain, a bug in the consensus algorithm, or changes to the node software. Check out our blog post </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/forking-explained/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Forking Explained&#8217;.</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-Sig or Multi-Signature</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-signature, or multi-sig, is a feature of bitcoin and other digital assets that requires multiple private keys to sign a transaction and move funds. Practically speaking, multi-sig can be used to add an extra layer of security to digital asset transactions by requiring additional approval from a third party before a transaction is approved. Digital asset custodians typically use multi-sig wallets and processes to help secure client funds.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Node</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nodes are software that run on internet-connected computers and function as non-mining transaction validators and digital asset wallets. In Bitcoin, for example, full nodes download the entire blockchain and validate each transaction per the agreed-upon rules of the network and relay transactions and blocks to others.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rollups</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rollups perform transaction execution outside layer one by “rolling up” or aggregating transactions, and then posting the data to layer one where consensus is reached. As transaction data is included in layer one blocks, rollups are secured by native base layer one security.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenomics</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenomics is the topic of understanding the supply and demand characteristics of crypto assets. Projects will have specific tokenomic designs to drive particular outcomes for their protocol. Circulating market capitalisation, fully diluted market capitalisation, airdrops, seed round fundraising, ICO/IDO and treasury are all items of consideration when designing a tokenomics model. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero-Knowledge Proof</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are an experimental technology that allow one to cryptographically prove a statement, without revealing the input data. For instance, one could prove that a transaction was included in the blockchain without telling you which transaction it is. This technology is currently being used in various layer two projects on Ethereum to enable Ethereum to scale appropriately in the future. </span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2021 was an incredible year for crypto with new all time highs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as many other assets. We also saw corporations and institutions support crypto like never before. The first Bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US and here in Australia we saw the country’s largest bank, CBA start offering crypto assets to their clients. If 2020 was the year of DeFi, 2021 saw a boom in the NFT market.</p>
<p>It’s incredibly hard to predict what will happen in the fast moving crypto markets, but here are my best bets for 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling</strong></p>
<p>2022 will be the year of scaling Ethereum. Together with alternative Layer 1s, my prediction is that Ethereum Layer 1 will become less than 50% of total DeFi TVL in 2022. By the end of 2022, the majority of TVL will be on Ethereum Layer 2s and alternative L1s. This would be a huge shift in the market, accelerated by the launch of L2 tokens on Arbitrum and Optimism. For the first time blockchains will be able to onboard 100s of millions of users.</p>
<p><strong>DeFi/Derivatives</strong></p>
<p>While the general market rallied in 2021, a surprising number of DeFi assets underperformed, some even posting negative fiat denominated returns for the full year. I think we will see a resurgence in DeFi assets in 2022 partly helped by scaling that will enable things like on-chain derivatives to a much larger extent. My prediction is for $1 trillion in DeFi TVL by the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Chain</strong></p>
<p>2021 was the year that cemented the thesis that we are moving into a multi-chain world. Infrastructure projects enabling this future, things like multi-chain DEXes and bridges will significantly increase in a value in 2022. My prediction is that we will see at least one of these multi-chain infrastructure projects enter the top 20 most valuable crypto assets.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Headwinds</strong></p>
<p>We didn’t see much regulatory developments in 2021. Perhaps the biggest development was the approval of the first Bitcoin ETF in the US (unfortunately futures based). My prediction is that we will see negative regulatory developments out of the US in 2022. Influential senators like Elizabeth Warren (who eg Ryan Selkis of Messari refers to as Satan) has recently expressed deeply flawed and negative bias against crypto. My hope is that any negative development out of the US will not spill over to the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Web3/Metaverse</strong></p>
<p>A mega-trend in 2021 was NFTs going mainstream. Currently, NFT are mostly used for art, collectibles and for in-game items. All these ares will continue to grow rapidly. Another potentially huge growth area of NFTs is the metaverse. My prediction is that we will see another mega corporation, the likes of a Google or Apple, follow Meta (formerly Facebook) and launch products/services to support metaverse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2021 Predictions Review </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>1</em></strong><em>. We will see the rise of Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. While there has been much talk about Ethereum 2.0, it is still years away in the sense of being useable for smart contracts. I believe we will see some big DeFi protocols move to L2 in 2021 accompanied by real volumes. I hope that the community will come to a consensus over which solution to use, be it Optimistic Rollups or something else, but that is probably wishing for too much.</em></p>
<p>We did see the launch of Ethereum L2s with support from mainstream protocols like Uniswap, Balancer, Synthetix etc. However we didn’t see significant TVL or usage on these L2 in 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.</strong> Coinbase will IPO on a major exchange such as the NYSE or Nasdaq. This event would bring a lot of attention to crypto and solidify Coinbase as the ‘Google’ (or is it IBM?) of crypto.</em></p>
<p>Coinbase did IPO in April of 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. </strong>Bitcoin will again see an all time high in 2021. My personal opinion is that Bitcoin could reach US$50,000-100,000 in this bull cycle. I believe this could happen in 2021.  Monetary policy will continue to pour cash into global economies throughout 2021 while the supply increase of Bitcoin has decreased to only 6.25 BTC per block or 1.7% supply inflation per year. This is a potent cocktail for the best performing asset in the world to continue to outperform.</em></p>
<p>This was spot on as Bitcoin hit an all time high above $68,000 in November of 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. </strong>We will see the rise of at least one trustless stablecoin. With trustless I mean a crypto backed stablecoin or an algorithmic stablecoin. I bet one of them will reach over 500M in market cap in 2021. </em></p>
<p>2021 was a huge year for trustless stablecoins. TerraUSD got 10bn in market cap, MIM 4.5 bn, Frax 1.9bn, Liquity USD 833M and Fei USD 762M. At Apollo, we continue to be mega-bullish trustless stablecoins.</p>
<p><em><strong>5.</strong> Finally, I predict Cardano will fall out of top 10 crypto assets as defined by Coingecko. While Cardano is a far superior crypto asset to a lot of other assets out there, the top 10 is still very inefficient and will continue to change dramatically over time. In the case of Layer 1 smart contract platforms, the competition is getting very intense and I’d be surprised if Cardano will stay in its current position.</em></p>
<p>Cardano didn’t fall out of top 10, currently sitting at spot number 7. According to DeFiLlama Cardano has the highest market cap to TVL of any blockchain. I think market cap will go down faster than they will gain TVL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By Henrik Andersson，Apollo Capital 首选投资官 CIO</p>
<p>对加密货币而言，2021年是不可思议的一年。比特币、以太坊及许多其他加密资产的价格都创下历史新高。我们还看到，企业和机构在前所未有地支持加密货币。第一个比特币相关的ETF在美国获得批准，并且澳大利亚最大的银行CBA开始向客户提供加密资产服务。如果说2020年是DeFi之年，那么2021年则见证了NFT市场的繁荣。</p>
<p>虽然很难预测瞬息万变的加密市场将会发生什么，但我还是尽我所能对2022年做出预测。</p>
<p><strong>扩展性</strong><br />
2022年将是以太坊扩展性大为发展的一年。我认为，在2022年，以太坊Layer 1在DeFi 上的总锁定价值（TVL）将降至50%以下。到2022年底，大部分TVL将会基于以太坊的Layer 2链和其他Layer 1 区块链。这将是市场的巨大转变，并且在Arbitrum和Optimism上推出Layer 2代币，会进一步推动这种变化。区块链也将首次搭载上亿用户。</p>
<p><strong>DeFi/衍生品</strong><br />
尽管整个加密市场在2021年上行，但大量DeFi资产的表现不及预期，甚至一些资产全年的法币计价回报表现为负收益。我认为，我们将在2022年看到DeFi资产的复苏，这在一定程度上得益于以太坊的扩展性，而扩展性将使链上衍生品等DeFi应用在更大程度上得以落地。</p>
<p>我的预测是，到今年年底，DeFi TVL将达到1万亿美元。</p>
<p><strong>多链</strong><br />
2021年论证了我们正进入多链世界的这一观点。而实现多链的基础设施项目，如多链DEX（去中心化交易所）和跨链桥等项目的价值将在2022年显著上升。</p>
<p>我的预测是，至少有一个多链基础设施项目将位列最具价值的20个加密资产。</p>
<p><strong>监管的不利因素</strong><br />
在2021年，监管方面并无显著进展。或许最大的进展便是，美国首支比特币相关ETF获批。但遗憾的是，这只是比特币期货的ETF，而不是真正的比特币ETF。</p>
<p>我的预测是，美国对加密资产的监管在2022年会更加苛刻。Elizabeth Warren等有影响力的参议员最近表达了对加密货币的偏见及不认可。我希望，美国的任何负面政策将来不会波及到世界其他地区。</p>
<p><strong>Web 3/元宇宙</strong><br />
NFT走向主流世界，这是2021年的一大趋势。目前，NFT主要用于艺术品、收藏品和游戏道具。所有这些领域将继续迅速发展。而NFT的另一个潜在的巨大增长领域则是元宇宙。</p>
<p>我的预测是，我们将看到另一家巨头企业（如谷歌或苹果等）会追随Meta（即脸书）的脚步，推出支持Meta的产品或服务。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>2021 Predictions Review</strong><br />
回顾2021年的预测，准确率高达 80%</p>
<p><strong>预测1：</strong>我们将看到以太坊Layer 2解决方案的崛起。虽然关于以太坊2.0的讨论已经很多了，但要真正用于智能合约的平台，还需要几年的时间。</p>
<p>我相信，在2021年，一些大型DeFi协议将迁移到多个Layer 2链上，并拥有真正的用户流量。我希望加密社区能够就使用哪种解决方案达成共识，如Optimistic Rollups抑或是其他，但我的期望可能太高了。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>在2021年，我们确实看到了在主流协议如Uniswap、Balancer、Synthetix等的支持下，多个以太坊Layer 2链面世了。然而，Layer 2链并未拥有大量的TVL，而且这些协议也没有应用在Layer 2上。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测2</strong>：Coinbase将在纽交所或纳斯达克等主流交易所上市。这一事件将引起人们对加密货币的大量关注，也将巩固Coinbase作为加密货币领域“谷歌”或“IBM”的地位。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>Coinbase的确于2021年4月份上市。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测3：</strong>比特币将在2021年再次创下历史新高。我个人认为，在这个牛市周期中，比特币价格可能达到5 -10万美元。我相信这可能会在2021年实现。2021年全年，货币政策将继续印钞，用以刺激全球经济。而比特币供应量的增幅已降至每区块6.25 BTC，或者说其每年的供应通胀仅为1.7%。这是世界上表现最好的资产，并将继续跑赢大盘。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>比特币在2021年11月突破68000美元关口，创下历史新高。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测4：</strong>我们将看到至少一种无需信任的稳定币的崛起。我指的是加密货币支持的稳定币或算法稳定币。我敢打赌，到2021年，其中一家公司的市值将超过5亿美元。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>2021年对稳定币来说是重要的一年。TerraUSD的市值为100亿美元，MIM为45亿美元，Frax为19亿美元，LiquityUSD为8.33亿美元，FeiUSD为7.62亿美元。在Apollo，我们继续看涨稳定币。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测5：</strong>Cardano将跌出Coingecko上十大加密货币资产的行列。尽管Cardano远胜于许多其他资产，但这所谓的前十排行榜依然不成熟，并将随着时间的推移而发生巨大变化。至于Layer 1智能合约平台，其竞争正变得愈加激烈。若Cardano仍能保持当前的排名，我会感到很惊讶。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>Cardano并未跌出前十名，目前排名第七。根据DeFiLlama Cardano的数据，在所有区块链中，Cardano拥有最高的市值/TVL 比例。但我认为，其市值下跌的速度会比获取TVL的速度更快。</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1626316134155_258">In 2011 Venture Capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> in the WSJ titled ‘Why Software is Eating the World’. The gist of that article was that more and more major industries and businesses were being run on software. Thus it would makes sense to invest in this new infrastructure despite the market creating a dot com bubble at the end of 90s.</p>
<p>We believe that crypto assets are powering a new generation of software and that this software has the power to disrupt many of today’s industries and businesses which in turn are run on software. However, we are not just talking about a new generation of software that is replacing the current system, we are talking about something much bigger — software that is displacing current business models. Just like Amazon disrupted bookstores, this new generation of software called crypto networks will disrupt some of today’s businesses built on software.</p>
<p>This new paradigm involving crypto assets that ends up with Software Eating Software is likely to play out in a gradual fashion going through different phases. Below I outline a possible scenario how it might play out:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1 — Software Eating Commodities</strong></p>
<p>Digital scarcity was the first application of crypto assets. Bitcoin like gold is scarce but is superior in many other ways through the power of being based on software. Bitcoin is programmable, can be stored more easily than a physical commodity, it can be sent quickly and effortlessly like an email, it can be easily divided and unlike gold its authenticity can be easily verified with software.</p>
<p>So in phase 1 of this crypto based revolution we have digital scarce objects and specifically Bitcoin as a digital Gold:</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2 — Software Eating Contracts</strong></p>
<p>In the second phase we have software performing simple contracts. These have so far centred around certain well defined financial contracts. These have recently gained traction in what has been called the Open Financial System or Decentralised Finance (DeFi). Contracts range from lending, borrowing to derivatives prediction markets and decentralised exchanges.</p>
<p>This is still a young market and many of the first services have just been launched in the past 6 months.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 3 — Software Eating Software</strong></p>
<p>In the third phase software primitives that have been developed and battle tested in phase 1 and 2 will be combined and reiterated over to create whole new applications that disrupt current businesses.</p>
<p>There will be new services built on the building blocks of the Open Financial System that will take market share from current centralised businesses for lending and borrowing. The first users will be those that value a permissionless and censorship resistant service. Many might be based in the developing world where access to financial services is limited.</p>
<p>Likewise, Decentralised Exchanges will take market share from more centralised brokers and exchanges with customers who value the obvious benefits of no or little counterparty risk.</p>
<p>Those who value a social network free from censorship might move to a more decentralised network built on top of a blockchain.</p>
<p>Today’s shared economy companies such as Uber, AirBnB etc could also be built on an open network — with no rent seeking middlemen.</p>

<p>These new blockchain based ‘businesses’ can be fuelled by crypto assets and the token-economics of the network act as a catalyst for adoption. No financial institution needs to be behind tomorrow’s lender, no company needs to be behind tomorrow’s Twitter, no platform fees need to be levied tomorrow’s Uber driver. Simply put, these could be the new public utilities built on open source code accessible anywhere by anyone at anytime.</p>
<p>10 years after the Bitcoin whitepaper, there is a growing consensus about the value of Digital Scarce commodities. We are seeing the first iteration of blockchain based contracts. Over the coming 10 years we will see crypto networks disrupt current businesses which in some cases will be replaced with open source software which for the first time can replace third parties and middlemen with open networks — this is the exciting new era of computing.</p>
<p>Still we face many challenges. Blockchains are slow, and in some cases they have proven to be insecure due to too much centralisation. Just like after the dot.com crash people are focusing on the bubbles and crashes that markets create and not on the breakthrough innovation.</p>
<p>Many of today’s crypto networks will fail to live up to the expectations. Still we see some of the best engineers working on solving some of the current challenges — that’s a huge opportunity and where we are putting our money to work.</p>

<p>For entrepreneurs this is great news, anyone can build on top of a platform like Ethereum, that’s the power of a permissionless blockchain. They are not restricted by the terms of services for an app store and they don’t have to give away a substantial part of their revenues to a third party. For the users, the benefits are security (centralised databases sooner or later gets hacked), ownership of data and identity and the freedom to move your data between the coming ecosystem of decentralised apps, or ‘dApps’.</p>
<p>Another way to think about this transition is to look at the value capture in this transition. Union Square in 2016 published the now famous <a href="http://www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘Fat Protocol’ hypothesis</a>.

<p>The idea is that value is following the data, so when we move to a decentralised world where blockchains are the new protocols for data and value — that is also where most of the value will be captured. We will have a massive ecosystem of application on top of these new protocols, but that’s not where the majority of the value will accrue.</p>
<p>We would like to add to this picture by stating that Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 will still be present alongside Web 3.0. Just like we have some mostly static informational web sites today reminiscent of Web 1.0, as we move to a more decentralised web, today’s most popular services will likely still exist. Facebook and Twitter will very likely still be present on the web for a long time still, and they are likely to continue to capture substantial value even in the future. We are indeed perhaps not primarily decentralising the current web. Instead blockchain technology enables a much bigger web through human and machine interactions that simply wasn’t possible before.</p>
<p>Apollo’s vision of the future is therefore a much bigger web that can capture more value than ever before:</p>

<p>Thanks to blockchain technology, we can now add substantial value to the current web, we believe mostly along three lines:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>Digital Ownership. Blockchain technology makes digital ownership possible. Be it of money, data, identity or digital goods.</li>
<li>Smart Contracts. With smart contracts an open financial system will be built and available to anyone in the world. Borrowing, lending, derivatives and the democratisation of fund raising. A longer term vision encompasses the rise of decentralised autonomous organisations or ‘DAOs’.</li>
<li>Tokenisation of Everything. I’ve <a href="https://medium.com/apollo-capital/the-future-tokenisation-of-everything-part-1-b21d6ca3a8eb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously written</a> on this topic and how real estate, hedge fund and VC interest will be tokenised and then later today’s liquid assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarise, Web 3.0 is less about the coming disruption of Facebook, Twitter and Uber and more about enabling new forms of value capture, uniquely enabled by blockchain technology. This is the exciting future we invest in and the reason we are so passionate about our mission at Apollo Capital.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1626318788106_219">We believe crypto assets have a specific function to play in providing the incentives to run a decentralised protocol. They are the fuel for running open, permissionless blockchains. The ICO hype created an environment where raising money became too easy. The result was that too many projects are trying to fit a token into a service or product where none is needed.</p>
<p>Blockchains are only valuable if they are decentralised. There are three major tenants of this technology and the applications running on top of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating censorship resistant applications: This can take many forms such as money, financial markets, gambling, prediction markets or social networks to name a few.</li>
<li>Creating permissionless applications: That is, an application that anyone can join. With Bitcoin you can be your own bank, or payment processor, without needing permission from a bank or credit card company.</li>
<li>Trustless applications: If we use a derivatives or a lending market, we don’t want to rely on the goodwill of a third party. With open source protocols anyone can inspect the code and the integrity of the application and engage in commerce with 0% counter-party risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a quote from fellow crypto hedge fund manager Tushar Jain:</p>

<p>Don’t pitch something that’s an easy pass</p>
<p>Many projects are creating a token where Bitcoin or Ether could be used, or maybe one of the many stablecoins. This is especially true if you’re creating a simple payment for service.</p>
<p>We think these ICOs should be funded by equity. At Apollo Capital, we see a future with millions of decentralised applications — and these will primarily be funded by equity. <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcompound.finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compound</a>, is an excellent example of a decentralised application built on top of smart contracts running on Ethereum. Compound is funded by equity, they are not creating a specific token where none is needed. This is how Apollo Capital forsees value accruing in the Web 3.0 era:</p>

<p>On one end there will be 1,000,000s of applications mostly funded by equity. On the other end there will be 10s of core blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dfinity et al. that run on, and in some cases are funded by, crypto assets. In between, we will have 1,000s of middleware crypto assets such as stablecoins, oracles, and file storage. Smart contracts built on top of blockchains will interact with these middleware building blocks. As an example, a smart contract interacting with a stablecoin and an oracle can provide the basics for an application providing trustless and permissionless lending and borrowing in this new decentralised world we call Web 3.0.</p>
<p>To sum it up — it is likely your ICO doesn’t need a token and if it doesn’t, it will become increasingly hard for you to get institutional funding for your project.</p>
<p>However, if your application is part of what is either a new core protocol or middleware project there might be a need for new a crypto asset. If you have unique technology and an ability to create the necessary network effect — come and speak with us!</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1626318881168_204">Applications for Crypto and Blockchain technology can be divided into use cases that on one hand provide incremental improvements to existing processes and on the other hand offer completely new and groundbreaking use cases that weren’t possible before.</p>
<p>The former group includes implementations of private, permissioned blockchains. It also includes the potential tokenisation of existing investment products such as real estate. These have the potential to incrementially improve exchange of information, settlement times, make previous illiquid markets liquid and fractionalise all kind of assets. As an example, the stock exchange in Australia, the ASX, is implementing blockchain technology for their settlement system. Two years ago it was supposed to be implemented in 18 months. Now they are targeting a launch at the end of 2020 which will take settlement times from T+3 to T+1, an improvment, but hardly a revolution. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has provided global settlements in 10 minutes for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>At Apollo, we think the more interesting use cases are the groundbreaking possibilities of crypto rather than the more incremental, blockchain improvements. This includes fundamentally distrupting how ‘money’ works; the creation of native digital goods; smart contracts that can disintermediate a number of industries. Put simply, the real revolution is about digital ownership and contracts between parties without a trusted third party. This wasn’t possible before Satoshi Nakamoto put the wheels in motion almost 10 years ago.</p>
<p>We believe a particular low-hanging fruit for smart contract technology is financial contracts. Some of the areas being built right now include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lending and borrowing. This will first happen with cryptocurrency. Dharma provides a peer-to-peer lending market in crypto based on smart contracts. Apollo Capital just <a href="https://medium.com/compound-finance/the-compound-ecosystem-fund-partners-43ec431e4d69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with Compound</a> to provide liquidity for the lending and borrowing of crypto assets. Compound will provide a trustless (without a trusted third party) way using smart contracts to increase the price discovery in crypto assets. Investors in Compound include the likes of Bain Capital. dYdX is another Silicon Valley firm creating price discovery through smart contracts. As an example, they are set to launch tokens that represent a short position in a particular crypto assets — we will then be able to trustlessly take a directional bet or a leverage long position by simply buying a single token.</li>
<li>The next evolution will happen once we marry smart contract technology with stablecoin technology. Some very smart people at organisations such as Circle, TrustToken, MakerDAO, Basis and Fragments are working on creating a stable cryptocurrency that is pegged to fiat currrency, a basket of fiat currencies or in the future, CPI. Once we have a reliable and trustless cryptocurrency that is stable, not only will merchant adoption for the first time be feasible but we can start doing lending, borrowing etc. pegged to our everyday currency.</li>
<li>Derivatives are well defined contracts that can be entered through smart contracts. With smart contracts, we can take derivative positions peer-to-peer without counterparty risk. Firmo is an example of a start-up creating a programming language for these type of contracts. Once Oracle technology (these provide a method for ‘real world’ data to be referenced in smart contracts) is developed, we will be able to make trustless derivatives based on any asset. Prediction markets like Augur are related to this development. Augur’s prediction market based on the Ethereum blockchain recently went live.</li>
<li>We have been writing about how all assets will eventually be tokenised. Once we have tokenised real estate, we will be able to put real estate in smart contracts which will open the market for mortgage-like products to be based on blockchain technology.</li>
<li>Oracles and smart contracts can provide the basis for insurance products that are running on a blockchain without a central company or decision maker — this is a potential <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftim.blog%2F2017%2F06%2F04%2Fnick-szabo%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Szabo explored on the podcast with Tim Ferriss</a>. One smart contract/DAO based insurance project is <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fethereum-powered-insurer-nexus-is-winning-over-blockchain-skeptics%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus</a>, they will start with insuring smart contracts. In the future we might see a wide range of insurance products being build on blockchains.</li>
</ul>
<p>The future of finance might look radically different. The technology is here and the first applications are being built right now. Kevin Kelly describes in the book <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FInevitable-Understanding-Technological-Forces-Future%2Fdp%2F0143110373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Inevitable</a> the unstoppable force of the momentum of an ongoing technological shift. Kevin explains that banning, prohibiting and trying to stop the inevitable is ususally counterproductive. We can and should regulate but change is inevitable. Crypto assets and blockchain technology is not going away, it is a force for good that can unlock tremendous value by disintermediating today’s trusted third parties. Some might say the future financial revolution is inevitable…</p>

<p>In the first part of this series,  I wrote about how a diversified portfolio may look like in world of tokenisation. I envisioned a world where investors’ portfolios will contain crypto assets in the form of digital gold (i.e. Bitcoin), stable coins and a series of traditional assets (both private and public) that will be tokenised. Here I look at the likely long term value of native tokens used to fuel decentralised crypto networks compared with utility tokens used to pay for goods and services within a network.</p>
<p>Crypto tokens were invented for used in decentralised blockchains to incentivise its stakeholders to contribute positively to the network (think of it as fuel for the network &#8211; just like money is to any market).</p>

<p>Today, there are over 1,600 crypto assets actively traded. Some digitally native startups are doing token sales to facilitate a network of early users. This is called open network design; tokens help overcome the bootstrap problem by adding financial utility when application utility is low.</p>

<p>Many of these crypto tokens are utility tokens which are used as payment for services sometimes on a centralised platform. These utility tokens are issued on top of other networks, such as Ethereum’s ERC-20 coins.</p>
<p>We are entering a world where we have hundreds of utility tokens that enable payment on crypto networks for specific goods and services. It is, however, unlikely we would want to hold a portfolio of all these different tokens, one for our internet provider, one for streaming music, one for the car-sharing network etc.</p>
<p>We are likely to see a massive increase in the tradability and fluidity between crypto assets. Decentralised markets with common liquidity pools will make trading into, between, and out of utility tokens effortless, seamless, instantaneous, and potentially unknown from the consumer’s perspective. A stable crypto coin may serve as the base transactional currency in this future world where money is streaming like data and where machines pay humans or other machines.</p>
<p>For this reason, in a world where everything is tokenised, the value of crypto assets are likely to consolidate along native crypto assets used to run blockchains, not in utility tokens. These native crypto assets are needed for blockchains to provide incentives for network resources such as processing power, bandwidth, or storage.</p>
<p>With coming interoperability between blockchains, we might even see consolidation within the blockchain ecosystem. Separate smart contract platforms could be run on a single blockchain hub that talks to these different blockchains.</p>
<p>It is too early to say how many different crypto assets will accumulate the vast majority of value. However if this future materialise, they will be part of an investor&#8217;s overall tokenised portfolio. That portfolio will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liquid. Tokenisation will create new markets that didn’t exist in the past.</li>
<li>Much more diversified. Assets not previously accessible will be accessible (think a fraction of land, real estate, or hedge fund interests)</li>
<li>Instantly rebalanced. Decentralised markets with instant liquidity will enable a portfolio to be rebalanced at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in this brave new world where we can take direct ownership of assets and software is programmed to handle trade, payment and settlement, a lot less intermediaries will be needed.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1626319702619_207">Tokenisation has the potential to dramatically change the nature of all asset classes. The first generation of crypto assets created new, digital assets like bitcoin and ether that only exists on their respective blockchains. Code governs these assets and ownership can be secured through public-key cryptography. The open-source code base is the governing law for these assets. We now have new assets; with Bitcoin, ‘digital gold’ was created, with Ethereum we got unstoppable smart contracts and we have currency that can take new form as money becomes programmable.</p>
<p>We no longer have to rely on third parties to transact and there is liquid markets that never closes. The potential for these new assets is great, and we can’t yet imagine all the potential use cases and possibilities.</p>
<p>The next generation of crypto assets are likely to tokenised traditional assets; real estate, equities, bonds, commodities, venture capital and hedge fund interest.</p>
<p><strong>New properties for traditional assets</strong></p>
<p>The driver for tokenisation of traditional assets is the technology enabling new properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>  Tokens are divisible. One Bitcoin is 100 million Satoshis (the smallest unit in Bitcoin). We will be able to transaction in small fractions of e.g. real estate.</li>
<li> We will be able to transfer ownership of all kind of assets seamlessly, instantly and at a very low cost. The overhead cost of the third parties currently involved will be minimised.</li>
<li>Previous illiquid assets will become liquid such as real estate, VC, and hedge fund interest. Liquidity premium is likely going to unlock value in these assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>As these assets tokenise they become programmable and tradable, new possibilities for escrow, and governance become possible.</p>
<p>New protocols for these assets are currently being formed. Firms like Harbor is working on the R-token standard for security tokens. As a result, regional-specific compliance and legality can be written into the smart contracts themselves.</p>
<p><strong>The Future Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>A future investment portfolio in a tokenised world might be completely liquid. It could consist of crypto assets like Bitcoin, a stable coin like Dai or Basis, and traditional tokenised assets like equities, bonds, real estate and alternative investments like venture capital and hedge fund interest.</p>

<p><strong>Key difference between crypto assets and tokenised traditional assets</strong></p>
<p>With Bitcoin and other purely digital assets we can secure ownership. However, this is not possible with a real world asset like real estate or gold. If we tokenise gold, the physical gold can be seized even if you control the private key. With Bitcoin, the ownership is guaranteed and there is no real world asset that can be compromised. Crypto assets are the only assets in the world that can’t be seized, that won’t be the case when we tokenise traditional assets.</p>
<p><strong>In Part 2, I will look at the role of utility tokens in this future portfolio.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1626322276862_190">I have spoken to over a thousand investors since launching  in November 2017. Despite meeting a number of savvy investors, many of whom have invested in the Fund, the overwhelming response to crypto has been one of caution and scepticism. By now, I’ve heard just about every response to why you should not invest in crypto. While some reasons for not investing in crypto are sound, others highlight common failings in investor psychology.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in and explore the 7 reasons why you should definitely not invest in crypto.</p>
<h2>1. I Don’t Understand It</h2>
<p>This is clearly the best reason not to invest in crypto.</p>
<p>Investors need to understand what they’re investing in, whether it be crypto, derivatives or exotic fish. A basic understanding is essential. Warren Buffett has said repeatedly, “don’t invest in something you don’t understand.”</p>
<p>Without an understanding, investors will not have conviction in their investments, will not be prepared for the investment journey and will likely make a poor sell decision.</p>
<p>There are two options for an investor that doesn’t understand an investment opportunity.</p>
<p>The first is to move on. If you don’t understand crypto, if it’s too complex or you simply don’t have the inclination to learn, the wise decision is to move on. Investors cannot be faulted for knowing their limitations.</p>
<p>Many investors don’t realise there is a second option: homework. Read, listen, watch, discuss and learn about the investment opportunity. Warren Buffett avoided investing in many of today’s most successful tech companies because he didn’t understand them. Perhaps he would have been even more successful if he made the effort to understand Internet companies? Applying this lesson to crypto, today’s investors might be more successful if they do the homework to understand crypto. For those interested in learning, <a href="https://www.apollocap.io/resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our resources page</a>is a wonderful place to start.</p>
<h2>2. Volatility</h2>
<p>Crypto is volatile. Apollo Capital recently <a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2018/6/19/analysing-crypto-fund-returns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysed the average returns of crypto Funds</a>and the results are fascinating. In a series of returns from June 2013 to April 2018, monthly returns varied from over -30% to over 400%. These returns are not for the faint hearted.</p>
<p>Investors need to know themselves. This sounds like a cliche, but it is true, especially when it comes to investing in crypto. Some investors can stomach volatility, some cannot. If the thought of the value of your crypto portfolio dropping by 20% in a given month makes you weak at the knees, crypto is not for you.</p>
<p>Volatility is relative to position sizing. The volatility of a given investment is relative to how much is invested. If an investor invests their life savings in crypto, the volatility would be extremely difficult to manage. The thought of losing 20% of your life savings in one month is frightening. However, a position of 2%, 5% or 10% of an investor’s portfolio in crypto might mean the volatility is less daunting.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example of investing 2% of a portfolio in crypto. If crypto goes down by 50%, the investor will lose 1% of their portfolio. While not desirable, most sophisticated investors can handle such a loss. Many investors don’t realise the potential upside from a 2% position. In <a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2018/8/3/should-you-add-crypto-to-your-investment-portfolio-this-article-was-originally-published-in-switzercomau" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent study by Apollo Capital</a>, a 2% allocation to crypto from Jan 2016 to Apr 2018 accounted for 50% of the portfolio’s return.</p>
<p>It is also important for investors to distinguish between the volatility of an investment and the volatility of a portfolio. Including a volatile investment, such as crypto, in a portfolio does not necessarily increase the overall volatility of the portfolio. It all depends how that investment is correlated to the other assets in the portfolio. Crypto assets have shown not to correlate to traditional asset classes. Put simply, even though crypto is volatile, including it in a diversified portfolio doesn’t make the portfolio more volatile. Investors can have the benefit of the return potential of crypto, while keeping the volatility of their overall portfolio constant.</p>
<h2>3. Crypto Has No Use</h2>
<p>Here, I will go no further than to quote Marc Andreessen’s New York Times’ article “<a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Bitcoin Matters</a>”:</p>
<p><em>Critics of Bitcoin point to limited usage by ordinary consumers and merchants, but that same criticism was leveled against PCs and the Internet at the same stage. Every day, more and more consumers and merchants are buying, using and selling Bitcoin, all around the world. The overall numbers are still small, but they are growing quickly. And ease of use for all participants is rapidly increasing as Bitcoin tools and technologies are improved. Remember, it used to be technically challenging to even get on the Internet. Now it’s not.</em></p>
<p>Crypto is not perfect. Nothing at this early stage of its development is faultless. We constantly remind investors of two crucial facts. The first is crypto is a technological breakthrough. The second is many of the world’s smartest computer scientists and technologists are working in crypto. And now after the ICO boom, some of the smartest minds in tech are working on delivering on the promise of this technology.</p>
<h2>4. Illegal Uses</h2>
<p>One of crypto’s first popular use cases was for nefarious purposes. Silk Road was an online marketplace where users could buy and sell illegal goods, including illicit drugs and firearms. Users generally paid for goods with Bitcoin, thinking it was untraceable and anonymous. Many bad actors have moved on from Bitcoin, realising that it is in fact traceable.</p>
<p>The question becomes whether these cryptos are used solely for illegal activities, or whether this is just one use-case. For example, the Internet is used for illegal activities, including piracy, identity theft and terrorists communications. Should we call for a ban of the Internet because it is used for Illegal activities? Yes the Internet is used widely for illegal activities, but this is a tiny percentage of the overall use of the Internet. Applying this to crypto, what percentage of the use case of crypto needs to be for illegal activities before it is worth banning? 10%? 50%? 100%? This is a tough question and different people will have different answers.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to know how widely crypto is used for illegal activities. Top researchers in the space have stated that any reported figures are, at best, an estimate. There needs to be a clear distinction between something that is designed for illegal activities and something that might be used for illegal activities. If something is designed solely or primarily for illegal activities, it should be shut down. Silk Road is a clear example. However, we know there are many use cases for crypto which is not illegal and indeed, is a force for good. It appears naive to avoid investing in something or using it, simply because it can be used for illegal activities.</p>
<h2>5. Another Bitcoin</h2>
<p>A common response I have heard from wary investors is will Bitcoin be the Myspace to another crypto’s Facebook? It’s a good question and there are two key responses.</p>
<p>The first is network effect. Network effects have been called the business model of the Internet. Bitcoin has the largest network and the most number of users. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s market cap and daily traded volume is roughly three times that of Ethereum, the second largest crypto. This is not to say that Bitcoin will be dominant for eternity. Network effects can be competed away. Myspace and Facebook is a well-known example. However, currently, Bitcoin is the dominant crypto and it will be extremely difficult for another “money-like crypto” to compete.</p>
<p>The second response is a portfolio approach. Investing in crypto is best done in a diversified portfolio. There is no reason why an investor cannot invest in both “Myspace” and “Facebook.” We don’t need to be exactly sure of which one will win, we don’t need to put all our eggs in one basket. With a technology this young, the best approach is to invest in a range of crypto projects which show enormous potential.</p>
<h2>6. Crypto Has No Intrinsic Value</h2>
<p>Another reason not to invest in crypto is because it has no intrinsic value. Crypto does not pay dividends, is not tied to cash flows, has no right to other assets.</p>
<p>This line of thinking requires a broader perspective. Let’s consider fiat currency. A $5 note has no intrinsic value, it’s simply a fancy piece of paper. The piece of paper is worth $5 because we all believe it’s worth $5. Some will argue that it’s backed by the government which issues the currency, but this doesn’t point to any intrinsic value. There have been plenty of cases where this backing has become worthless, like the current crisis in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Another example is gold. Gold has been the worldwide store of value for thousands of years, yet where is its intrinsic value? Gold is valuable because we all believe its valuable. In both cases of fiat currency and gold, neither has any intrinsic value. Yet they are valued because we are told to value them and we collectively believe in their value. We all believe they have value until we stop believing.</p>
<p>We could argue that this applies to any asset class — there is no such thing as intrinsic value. The value of all assets comes from the perception that other investors, often called the market, would be willing to pay for that asset. In some asset classes like equities and real estate, the models used to value the asset are well established and well known by market participants. The value of other assets, like commodities, currencies and crypto, are determined by the forces of supply and demand. Investors point to discounted cash flow models and net present values, but the only model that truly works to value an asset is working out what someone else is willing to pay for it. That’s where value comes from. In crypto, the asset class is young, scarce, not well understood, is a technological breakthrough and we believe the demand for these assets will increase in the future.</p>
<h2>7. Wait and See</h2>
<p>At the start of the article, I mentioned that some of the reasons for not investing in crypto are examples of failures in investor psychology. The “Wait and See” approach is the most serious of these failings. In most cases, it will only lead to worse investor outcomes.</p>
<p>Let’s analyse the scenarios for the Wait and See investor after crypto prices go up, go down or go sideways</p>
<ol>
<li>Crypto Prices Go Up — prices have gone up, therefore crypto is great and I’m now comfortable to invest, albeit at a higher entry point</li>
<li>Crypto Prices Go Down — the investor gets scared, there must be something wrong with crypto, and decides not to invest</li>
<li>Crypto Prices Go Sideways — crypto isn’t that impressive, what’s all the fuss about?</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the biggest lessons from co-founding Apollo Capital is how I have observed countless investors, including sophisticated and professional investors, using price as a proxy for quality. At Apollo Capital, the interest we have received in investing in crypto has been directly correlated to the price of crypto. Prices goes up, everyone wants to invest. Prices go down, no one wants to. We all like to believe we are capable of going against the heard, being the contrarian investor who reaps the uncommon gains, but most of this is self-delusion. I haven’t heard one investor say “I’d like to invest, but I’d like to see prices drop to buy in cheaper.”</p>
<p>The approach we advise is the same as analysing any other asset class: it comes down to fundamentals. While crypto assets don’t have fundamental earnings, business plan or asset backing, the fundamentals in crypto is the technology. Investors need to understand or at least appreciate that crypto is a technological breakthrough, it is early, and that there could be huge demand for these assets in the future. Price action should have no impact on investors’ decision making.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Crypto is not for everyone. In the basket of alternative assets, it is an alternative asset. There are a number of sound reasons why investors should not invest in crypto. Yet, through my own personal journey in crypto, I learnt an important lesson. When I first heard of Bitcoin, I dismissed it almost instantly. It might have been fear of the unknown or because crypto is difficult to understand. It was easier for me to dismiss crypto and move on, than to keep an open mind and learn about it. Now, with the benefit of perfect hindsight, I realise I should have set aside a few hours and learnt about this fascinating new technology. It would not have cost much to invest a small percentage of my portfolio. At worst I would have lost my investment, shrugged it off and moved on. Instead, I was later than I would have liked to what is shaping up to be the biggest investment opportunity of my lifetime. I wonder whether the same applies to investors today who are yet to invest in crypto.</p>
