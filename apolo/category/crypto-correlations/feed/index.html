										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent correction in financial asset valuation had been a reckoning many global macro focused investors warned about for years.  The long-feared QT and interest rate normalisation have impacted liquidity and a re-rating of financial assets.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, central bank action has been limited relative to market expectations.  However, sticky inflation numbers and central bank recognition of their slow response have increased expectations for sizeable action over coming periods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first signal of a changing of the guard began in February 2021, as long-term interest rates began to rise.  That month, the US 10-year rate increased from 1.17% to 1.67%.  The technology darlings, often without any positive earnings, were in the firing line. For example, ARKK fell 34% by May 2021 and by June 14, 2022, it had dropped 76% from its Feb 2021 high.  Understandably, long duration equities are expected to deliver a higher proportion of future cash flows in the distant future and can be expected to suffer in a rising rate environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More generally, as interest rates have increased since January 2022 (US 10-year yield from 1.68% to 3.48%) the SP 500 has fallen over -22.1% from all time highs, and US government bonds (TLT -20 year) have lost -24.3% YTD (both in US$).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto and digital assets, also considered a disruptive technology, have suffered in this environment.  As of 20 June 2022, BTC/USD has fallen 70.1% from its 2021 peak, and the Crypto10 index (Top 10 crypto assets by market cap) has fallen 81.5% from its November 2021 highs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many headlines promote the demise of innovative technology and crypto with their price falls, the long-term participants in small cap technology and crypto environments have experienced frequent falls of significant magnitude in the past.  The table below highlights the volatility and price swing potential in BTC/USD. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understandably, the volatility and risk of capital loss would dictate sizing within a portfolio to be relatively small. For example, a typical allocation may be .50% to 3.0% of a total portfolio, with crypto enthusiasts holding a higher level.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure 1  BTC/USD Historical Worst Drawdowns</span></i></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1489" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BTC-Drawdowns-1.jpg" alt="" width="1263" height="982" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BTC-Drawdowns-1.jpg 1263w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BTC-Drawdowns-1-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BTC-Drawdowns-1-1024x796.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BTC-Drawdowns-1-768x597.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1263px) 100vw, 1263px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Asset Allocation and Re-Balancing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our view, overall portfolio asset allocation should be constructed for all economic environments. This macro winter&#8217;s fall in bonds and equities highlights the flaws of 60/40 portfolio allocation and an overreliance on historical correlation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, allocations for growth, recession, inflation, and deflationary periods (see Permanent Portfolio or Artemis’s Dragon Portfolio) are more fundamentally diversified portfolios, enabling rebalancing when markets present opportunities. This includes selling winners and re-balancing regularly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In evaluating the impact of a 3% BTC-USD allocation to a 60/40 portfolio from 2017 to the end of May 2022, investors would still be significantly ahead.  Importantly, BTC has faced three significant ‘crypto winters’ in this 5-year period, falling over 50% on each occasion. (Dec 2017-Dec 2018 fell more than 83%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following chart and table of performance include regular re-balancing (quarterly) of a portfolio comprised of 60% SP 500, 30% TLT (20-year US bonds) and 10% ST vanguard treasury compared with a portfolio of 60% SP 500, 30% TLT (20-year US bonds), 7% ST vanguard treasury, and 3% BTCUSD.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1494" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image.png" alt="" width="1302" height="675" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image.png 1302w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-300x156.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-1024x531.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-768x398.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1302px) 100vw, 1302px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1495" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc.jpg" alt="" width="1871" height="803" data-wp-editing="1" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc.jpg 1871w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-300x129.jpg 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-1024x439.jpg 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-768x330.jpg 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-1536x659.jpg 1536w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1pictures-btc-1568x673.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1871px) 100vw, 1871px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As highlighted above, SP 500 and TLT (20 year) have weighed heavily in the performance attribution in this macro winter. While crypto assets have not provided diversification in this environment, they certainly are not the main culprits of capital destruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active portfolio management and the ability to take profit on the way up, rebalance, and conversely, in this environment, re-balance from cash and outperforming defensive assets into high quality risk assets at depressed pricing should continue to serve investors well.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, risk assets, including small cap innovative technology, have a role to play in prudent investment portfolios.  While no one has 100% certainty on how long this macro winter will last or how far risk assets may fall, an environment for growth assets will return at some point in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our view, Bitcoin and Ethereum are credible innovative technologies that will exist and thrive as the adoption of blockchain, smart contracts and non-inflationary assets continue to grow.  Other technology, including AAPL, AMZN, high-quality smaller cap technology companies and new digital assets, will go through a re-rating in this macro winter, and all survivors will build into the next cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sizing of higher volatile assets in a portfolio, especially within the nascent digital asset class, should be represented in small allocations.  However, as illustrated, small allocations can have a meaningful positive asymmetric impact on portfolio returns and improved risk adjusted returns &#8211; especially for investors that re-balance regularly.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching Apollo Capital in early 2018, we have kept a keen eye on the correlations between crypto assets and traditional assets. Crypto assets have had a unique path. They are the first asset class that has started with retail participants, slowly working their way up to institutional investors. Almost always, a new asset class will start with the privileged elite, slowly making its way down to retail investors, if ever. This unique path has led to an independence of crypto assets &#8211; they are independent, by their nature, from traditional assets. We have long suggested that this independence should, in theory, lead to a lower correlation in performance. The data has generally backed up this theory, but as is with most matters relating to crypto, it’s an evolving story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We last provided an update on crypto correlations in October 2020. In </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/crypto-correlations-post-coronavirus-panic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we showed that crypto correlations had increased significantly as a result of the March 2020 sell off across almost all asset classes. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto assets and equities are fundamentally different, but their recent correlation is a result of the ‘risk off’ attitude that was prevalent in the weeks following the initial market panic.</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thought it timely to re-run the data with a view to answering the question, do crypto assets correlate with traditional assets?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Data</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In calculating the correlations between crypto assets and traditional assets, we have used the Apollo Capital Fund’s monthly returns since inception on 1 February 2018. For traditional assets, we have used various Vanguard Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. All performance data is calculated in Australian dollars. To our increasingly global audience, we expect the key themes of this data will hold in different currencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If two assets are perfectly correlated, that is, their price action moves perfectly in sync, we can expect a correlation number of 1. If two assets are inversely correlated, that is, their price action moves in the exact opposite direction, we can expect a number of -1. If two assets are not correlated at all, we can expect a number of 0.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, using the same data, Australian Equities have a correlation of 0.79 to International Equities &#8211; they are not perfectly correlated, but they tend to move in tandem.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1392 aligncenter" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table-300x150.png" alt="" width="622" height="311" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table-300x150.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table-768x384.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Crypto-Correlations-Table.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see from the above table that crypto asset correlations have largely decreased since September 2020. The extra 16 data points (the months between Sep 2020 and Jan 2022) have seen crypto assets correlation to Australian Equities decrease from 0.39 to 0.26. International and US Equities have also decreased. At 0.26, we wouldn’t say that crypto assets are not correlated to Australian Equities, but we’d say they are largely uncorrelated. We could conclude that crypto assets are not correlated to Australian bonds, International Bonds and Gold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this mean that crypto assets are correlating even less to traditional assets? Unfortunately, we don’t think it’s that simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data in the table above is point to point &#8211; encapsulating all performance from 1 February 2018 to 31 January 2022. While we can draw valuable insights from a point to point comparison, it does not tell us anything about what happened along the way. It is also valuable to analyse rolling crypto correlations, how correlations have changed over a period of time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolling Correlations</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolling correlations are calculated by analysing performance data over a given length of time. As new data points become available, older data points drop off. For example, the twelve month rolling correlation on 31 January 2019 will only take into account performance data from 1 February 2018 to 31 January 2019. As we roll forward to 28 February 2019, the February data point in 2018 is discarded and updated with the February data point for 2019. We can perform this analysis for different rolling lengths of time, for example, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. We would expect a smoother result for longer periods of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start with the 24-month rolling period. The Equities Group is fairly smooth. Australian Equities starts at around 0.50 and over the past year has largely stayed around 0.20 &#8211; 0.25.  International Equities and US Equities are fairly consistent around 0.20. The correlation with gold displays a little volatility. Interestingly, the correlation with Bonds goes from reasonably positive to reasonably negative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1398 aligncenter" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3-300x185.png" alt="" width="628" height="387" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3-300x185.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3-1024x633.png 1024w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3-768x474.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/24-Month-Rolling-Correlations-3.png 1533w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the point to point comparison and the 24-month rolling period are interesting, they can often smooth over interesting takeaways. Let’s take a look at the 12-month rolling correlation. (We have removed a number of the asset classes, otherwise it’s very hard to follow).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1394 aligncenter" src="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-Month-Rolling-Correlations-300x185.png" alt="" width="585" height="361" srcset="https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-Month-Rolling-Correlations-300x185.png 300w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-Month-Rolling-Correlations-768x475.png 768w, https://www.apollocap.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-Month-Rolling-Correlations.png 786w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focussing on Australian Bonds and Australian Equities, we can see there is a larger degree of volatility in the correlations with crypto assets. Australian Bonds varies significantly, starting negative, before increasing to meaningfully positive, before decreasing to meaningfully negative. Australian Equities also shows a deal of volatility, as correlations increased after March 2020, before decreasing to meaningfully negative in mid 2021 and recently turning positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time we provided an update on correlations we concluded that in a ‘risk off’ environment, crypto assets were not spared. As equity markets began to price in the effects of Covid-19 in March 2020, crypto assets did as well. Equity markets then recovered, as did crypto markets. This appears to have been the case in recent months with interest rate hikes and market concerns over tapering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe there are two key takeaways from this analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Takeaway #1: crypto assets are not a short-term hedge</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To describe crypto assets as a hedge against equity markets is unrealistic. Equally, we don’t think it is appropriate to describe a young technology as a safe haven asset class. It is unrealistic to view crypto assets as a safe haven asset class as well as a technological innovation with enormous upside potential. We believe this description of a safe haven asset class has come about due to the comparison of Bitcoin and Gold going too far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have two strong data points now in March 2020 and in January 2022 clearly showing that crypto markets will not perform well if there is widespread sell off in other asset classes. Perhaps we thought it might be the case a number of years ago due to crypto&#8217;s independent nature, but it would be naive to expect it going forward.</span></p>
<p><strong>Takeaway #2: crypto assets are still largely uncorrelated to traditional assets </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see from both the table above and the 24-month rolling correlation graph that crypto assets, over a long period of time, are still largely uncorrelated to traditional assets. If anything, it appears crypto assets have become less correlated over the last two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between these two takeaways is timeframe. Over a short period of time, especially in a ‘risk off environment&#8217;, crypto assets will likely not perform well and correlation to equities in particular will increase. A simple explanation for this is in the ‘risk off environment:’ investors sell everything, including crypto assets, and move to cash and perhaps gold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over a longer period of time, we clearly demonstrate that crypto correlations are still relatively low. We believe this independence described in the opening paragraph still holds. Crypto assets are still largely independent from traditional assets. We believe an asset class with enormous potential and a low correlation to other assets is worth considering in the overall portfolio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this feeds back into our broader narrative at Apollo Capital: we believe there is a strong argument for a small allocation to crypto assets within the broader portfolio for long-term, patient investors. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Crypto-Powered Future is Already Here</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing is essentially an attempt to predict the future by allocating capital to the most promising companies, technologies, or economic models, adjusted for risk tolerance. In December 2003, William Gibson, one of the most influential Cyberpunk authors, wrote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;The future is already here – it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that some people are already doing and experiencing the futuristic things that the larger population will see as commonplace in the near future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crypto-powered, decentralized, and blockchain-enabled future world is already here; it just hasn’t reached everyone yet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Crypto is eating the world, and it’s happening faster than you think</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years ago in August 2011, Internet pioneer and visionary venture capitalist, Marc Andreesen, published a blog in the Wall Street Journal called, </span><a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Software Is Eating the World</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In it, he described how Software and Web companies were disrupting and supplanting many real-world industries and legacy business models, and at the same time dispelled arguments that this was a dangerous bubble similar to the Dot Com era of the late 1990’s. He should know. Marc was a founder of Netscape, which developed the world’s first user-friendly Web browser, and whose IPO in 1995 sparked that boom and launched the beginning of the Internet Age. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eventual ubiquity and inevitably of Software and the Web looks blindingly obvious with the benefit of hindsight, but it was not well understood nor distributed at the time. The same arguments are now being made against Crypto; that it’s an unsustainable and speculative bubble, a niche technology used by a minority of people, and a fad that will be regulated out of existence if it becomes too successful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto combines software with cryptography and decentralized blockchain technology, and is powered by network effects, viral propagation, consensus governance mechanisms, and transparent financial and behavioral incentives. Many industry participants including Alex Mashinsky and Raoul Paul have already observed that ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now eating the world’, disrupting traditional financial markets and even some of the same software business models that Marc wrote about. Unsurprisingly, Andreesen Horowitz was an early </span><a href="https://a16z.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters-nyt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocate of Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2014, and recently raised a second $2.2 billion venture capital fund to invest in this emerging asset class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Apollo Capital, it is our belief that we have already entered a new era (perhaps ‘the Crypto Age’) where large parts of our daily lives – work, social networks, financial capital, human interaction, entertainment, gaming, music, and artistic creativity – will be digitized and increasingly tokenized to be stored and exchanged on a blockchain. These will be overlapping and interacting networks of value that will benefit from Metcalfe’s Law of exponential growth. Few understand that we are in the midst of a revolution in money, finance, and culture that is in the early days of adoption and price discovery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Traditional Finance is the Main Course</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto has found a major product-market fit in the area of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). DeFi is an emerging ecosystem of financial applications and interoperable protocols built on blockchain technology that has begun eating away at the multi-hundred trillion dollar capital markets including borrowing and lending, market-making, store of value, fixed income, derivatives, foreign exchange, payments, remittances, mortgages, asset management, and interest rate swaps, among others – all without a real world financial intermediary. Instead, ‘smart contracts’, written in software code, control the execution of every transaction, removing counterparty risk and the need for a centralized authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a Cambrian explosion of new DeFi projects, and enormous amounts of capital are already flowing into DeFi as the Total Value Locked (TVL) has reached $195 billion, an 830% increase so far this year. Much of the activity is taking place on the Ethereum network, which settles $500 billion of transactions each month and is on pace to settle $8 trillion in 2021, the most in Crypto. ETH, the native token of Ethereum, which generates more than $20 million in daily fees for network miners, is predicted to become a deflationary asset (the total supply decreases over time) starting in 2022 with its migration to a ‘proof of stake’ consensus model. ETH is being described as ‘ultra-sound money’; a potentially superior store of value and a medium of exchange for a wide range of Internet transactions. Compared to Bitcoin’s singular value proposition of an immutable digital store of value, Ethereum, as the original smart contract platform, has many more use cases in DeFi. The Lightning Network is a “Layer 2” scaling protocol that has been in development for years and will enable faster transactions and payments on the Bitcoin network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The innovative economic structures of the future will not be traditional corporations, but rather </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/2021/07/the-era-of-the-dao/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DAOs), operated by volunteer communities of software and capital contributors with democratic and transparent governance policies enacted by proposal voting according to the ownership of protocol tokens. For Crypto projects, DAOs will replace highly regulated legal and hierarchical structures that are controlled by Board of Directors, full-time management teams, and equity shareholders. Driven by open source software, Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), rather than centralized Stock Exchanges, facilitate roughly $60 billion per month of permissionless peer-to-peer trading, creating high liquidity for the vast majority of tokens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another relatively recent innovation, US-dollar pegged stablecoins, have a current market value of $130 billion and enable near instant transfer of value anywhere in the world. Anyone who has tried to wire money overseas (even to an account they own) knows the pain, delay, and limitations of the byzantine and antiquated banking system. In free markets, improved user experience and reduced cost will always prevail over incumbent solutions. The commercialization of the Web has proven this beyond any doubt. Traditional Banks will either soon experience NGMI (“Not Gonna Make It”), or if they want to retain customer deposits, plug directly into DeFi platforms to offer innovative payment and yield products. The leading centralized Crypto exchange, Coinbase, has announced it will allow customers to deposit paychecks directly to their accounts. Shots fired!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>The Web, Culture, and Gaming will be Dessert</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto will infiltrate and permeate just about everything that’s accessible online, and onboard a large new audience to the Crypto asset ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook, with 2.9 billion global users, recently announced it is betting the company’s future on transitioning into a Metaverse company, and is pursuing plans to launch a Crypto stablecoin called Diem. PayPal has integrated Crypto into its global person-to-person and e-commerce payment network. Visa, Mastercard, and Verifone are doing likewise. Reddit, the Web’s largest discussion board platform, launched an Ethereum-based rewards program for community members. Amazon has been rumored to be researching a token strategy. Companies like Microsoft, KFC, The Dallas Mavericks, Norwegian Air, and countless online stores already accept payment in Crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the first Non-Fungible Token was minted on a blockchain in 2014, NFTs (often priced in ETH) really hit the popular zeitgeist in late 2020 with major drops by artists like Beeple and Trevor Jones setting sales records that rivaled the Masters of the traditional fine art world. EtherRocks, Bored Apes, and Crypto Punks are the new ultimate status symbol assets (or “flex”) with collectors now using these unique digital NFTs as online identity avatars. Twitter will soon allow its 350 million users to authenticate their ownership of NFTs on the platform. Jack Dorsey has integrated Bitcoin into both Square, for investment and trading, and Twitter, for tipping and payments. Multi-chain wallets for storing and transacting in Crypto are already integrated into Web browsers and likely soon into Apple Wallet and Google Pay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online gaming is adopting in-game NFTs and has created a ‘Play-To-Earn’ (P2E) business model where players receive tokens and unique items as rewards, based on their skill and achievements. The leading P2E game, Axie Infinity, is on track to generate $1.4 billion in 2021 revenue and has 350,000 daily players, mostly in the Philippines, who are often earning enough to make a living and support their families. Axie’s $35 billion market cap places it in the top five most valuable gaming companies in the world. Using NFTs, cross-game marketplaces, and the blockchain to verify and transport their avatars and items, Crypto game players will interact in an interoperable virtual universe (aka “The Metaverse”). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fashion and music industries will also incorporate NFTs. Dolce &amp; Gabbana recently sold their first NFT collection for $5.65 million. Songs will soon be tokenized so that fans can participate in their ownership and earn royalties from their favorite artists, establishing music as a new form of investment. NFTs will exist at the intersection of culture and finance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking this trend to its logical and fullest expression, we expect the major Social Networks, gaming companies, music streamers, and Web services will integrate Crypto and decentralize their platforms to some degree. The massive global outage of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp is a glaring example of why a decentralized Web is the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Dinero Mágico de Internet</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very few people (other than Jack Mallers from Strike) expected a country to adopt Crypto in 2021, and yet El Salvador, which translates to “The Savior”, made Bitcoin legal tender alongside the almighty US dollar in June. According to President Nayib Bukele</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 million people or nearly half of the 6.4 million Salvadorans are already actively using the state-backed Chivo Bitcoin wallet. That is more accounts than any single bank in the country and likely on track to exceed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banks in the country. Talk about banking the unbanked!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its historical volatility, Bitcoin is the best performing asset of any kind over the last 10 years. Much concern has been expressed over Bitcoin’s power usage and carbon footprint, and perhaps this is warranted, but Bitcoin will have positive benefits as it monetizes the stranded power from legacy utilities and remote renewable sources. Electric utilities in the US are turning to Bitcoin mining to capture off-peak power and for load balancing. Ukraine has formally legalized Crypto and is exploring Bitcoin mining using nuclear power. Laos and Paraguay are legalizing Bitcoin trading and have announced plans to utilize excess hydro-generated power for mining. El Salvador’s state-owned power company will provide mining facilities with cheap, clean geothermal energy, harnessed from the country&#8217;s volcanoes. Understandably, very few people want to live anywhere near a volcano and the lack of a robust electricity grid can make transmitting power to urban centers uneconomical. Bitcoin fixes this. The limitless geothermal energy can be transformed into digital value and transmitted cheaply. Think of this as a store of abundant energy in a digital battery, or even digital gold that can be dug up and transmitted at the speed of light. In doing so, Bitcoin may ultimately hasten the adoption of renewable energy worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare this forward thinking to the United States where the SEC is still dragging its heels on approving any of the 18 Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications on file. It’s only a matter of time, though, and this will be a major step forward to widespread adoption of Crypto, triggering a huge inflow of new capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong><i>Software Disruption Meets the Velocity of Capital</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Crypto, the disruptive forces of software (digital distribution, iterative improvements, and decentralized contribution) combine with the velocity of capital (highly fluid liquidity that seeks yield, removes inefficiencies and intermediaries) to create a powerful, global, and permissionless 24/7 digital free market whose goal is adoption, efficiency, and exchange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are two relentless and insatiable forces that will drive widespread adoption and propagate Crypto through their inherent positive feedback loops across concentric networks of value. Money is becoming programmable, and the definition of and types of money will evolve and their uses will mushroom. Crypto is truly “the future of finance”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto has the incredible advantage of leveraging decades of global Internet and mobile infrastructure investment and adoption that will facilitate its exponential growth. Roughly 48% of the world&#8217;s population, or 3.8 billion people, own a smartphone and can access decentralized browser-based Crypto and DeFi platforms, democratizing financial inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin, and the entire Crypto movement, was born out of the Global Financial Crisis in 2009, and the ongoing debasement of Fiat currencies, negative real yields, and the growing distrust of government and financial institutions have proven powerful accelerants. The “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/O1hCLBTD5RM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money Printer go Brrr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” meme has done more to explain the current Central Bank monetary policy than any Economics textbook. Innovative companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Galaxy Digital have adopted Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset to help solve the ‘</span><a href="https://youtu.be/WrR95PFYDFQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">melting ice cube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ problem of Fiat currency, as Michael Saylor calls it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With BTC at $47,000 and ETH at $3,300, the entire Crypto market is valued at roughly $2.1 trillion, which would rank it between the market caps of Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft. For reference, the global stock markets are valued at $95 trillion, gold at $11 trillion, the broad M2 money supply is another $100 trillion, and outstanding bonds are valued at $130 trillion. With the current trajectory and inertia, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine Crypto’s market cap increasing 3-10x over the next decade. Bullish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>The Final Boss</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the major risks to Crypto&#8217;s success – technology, value proposition, economic model, product-market fit, and consumer and institutional adoption – are well on the way to being solved. What’s left to overcome? Nation State attacks and unreasonable financial regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve already seen a concerted, multi-year attack by China with its “banning of Crypto” (annually since 2013!) and it’s recent total ban on Bitcoin mining, which caused a mass exodus of miners, a broad market panic sell-off, and a significant impact to the network hash rate (a measure of the processing power that secures the Bitcoin network). Impressively, this forced a dramatic decentralization of the network, which is now reassembling itself in more favorable jurisdictions like the US, Canada, Russia, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and Kazakhstan with the </span><a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hash rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already back to mid-May 2021 levels. This is a long-term positive, removes a key vulnerability, and has proven the Bitcoin network’s resilience and antifragility. Is the Law of Unintended Consequences a thing in China?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems the Final Boss for Crypto to defeat is the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission and what form the now certain regulation will take. Our expectation is that regulation will be a long-term positive as the framework will provide legal, tax, and regulatory certainty, and more formally integrate Crypto into the global economy, allowing broad participation from investment funds, retirement accounts, corporate treasuries, and sovereign wealth funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Apollo Capital, we expect significant ongoing market volatility in the short-term, but we are exceptionally confident in the long-term fundamental thesis that Crypto will power the new decentralized financial infrastructure of Web 3.0. The profound and disruptive innovation will continue despite token price fluctuations, and provide an asymmetric return opportunity for investors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Number Go Up</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To adapt a phrase about Software disruption from Marc Andreesen in 2011, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next 10 years, the battles between incumbents and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-powered insurgents will be epic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. However, Crypto will be different; globally inclusive, open source, censorship resistant, spearheaded by decentralized volunteer communities applying their own capital and ingenuity, fueled by memes and a desire to effect real change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward ten years from now, Crypto’s rise will look obvious and inevitable&#8230; just as the dominance of Software and the Web do today.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enormous credit and gratitude to Marc Andreesen, Mike Novogratz, Jack Mallers, Jack Dorsey, Michael Saylor, Elon Musk, President Nayib Bukele, Satoshi Nakamoto, and Vitalik Buterin for their leadership and inspiration. </span></em></p>

<p class="">Periods of performance like this are not uncommon in crypto markets. But for new investors, what is the best strategy to allocate into these markets?</p>
<p class="">Before we put forward some thoughts, please let us be clear that this is not financial advice. Please do your own research and seek advice. We’re simply trying to conceptualise ways in which to allocate to a strong market.</p>
<p class="">Many new investors ask “how do you see markets performing over the next few months.” As much as people love to forecast, the only answer is “we don’t know.” Crypto markets are highly volatile and the market could just as easily ‘correct’ down 30% as it could jump another 100%.</p>
<p class="">We understand why investors ask this question. A new investment will be judged most harshly in its first months, particularly one in a volatile market such as crypto. A 30% correction is much easier to stomach after 2 years and +700% than it is after an initial allocation.</p>
<p class="">However, we must acknowledge that we don’t know the short term price fluctuations. Instead, we take a longer term view &#8211; new investors in crypto markets are still very early. We acknowledge that we’re in a bull market, we don’t think it’s over, but there will always be corrections and periods of consolidation.</p>
<p class="">If an investor accepts this starting point, the question then becomes one of timing. When is the best time to invest?</p>
<p class="">We believe we see a number of investors making mistakes with the timing of their investment decision. A common mistake we see is waiting for a pullback. We have spoken to a number of investors who are keen to allocate to crypto, but are “waiting for Bitcoin to retrace back to $30,000.” If an investor is keen to invest in crypto assets, we think this is a risky strategy. We know many investors that are still waiting for a pull back to $2,000. Now that might happen one day, but it’s becoming increasingly unlikely and increasingly painful for those investors.</p>
<p class="">We think a more prudent strategy is to carve an allocation into different tranches. If an investor has $100,000 to allocate to crypto markets, they could think about investing in crypto markets in say 3 or 4 tranches. Let’s say an investor chooses to invest across four tranches of $25,000. This strategy is commonly known as dollar cost averaging.</p>
<p class="">One strategy that we have seen is to make an initial allocation of $25,000, and at least <strong>get into the market</strong>. If an investor thinks a pull back to $30,000 is more likely than a jump to $100,000, it might still make sense to invest the initial tranche. If markets continue to increase, the initial allocation increases in value and the investor is up. If markets decrease, then it presents a buying opportunity to deploy further tranches. If Bitcoin and broader crypto assets end up retracing to $30,000, it might be an opportunity to deploy another one or two tranches.</p>
<p class="">Dollar cost averaging might seem like an overly simple strategy. It is often dismissed and ridiculed. Investors often like to think they can time their investments more strategically with the right amount of analysis and insight. Yet, as much as we humans like to think we can predict the future and time our investments to perfection, we think a more prudent strategy is to recognise our limitations.</p>
<p class="">We simply don’t know how crypto markets will perform over the short and medium term. Dollar cost averaging might be a prudent strategy in the highly volatile world of crypto assets, and make that initial allocation a little easier.</p>

<p class="">Apollo Capital has consistently reported that crypto assets do not correlate with traditional assets. Crypto assets are largely driven by a different investor base and are fundamentally unique. We believe that there is a strong argument for a small allocation to crypto assets within a broader portfolio, in part due to their lack of correlation to traditional assets.</p>
<p class="">Following the coronavirus market panic in March earlier this year, crypto assets have demonstrated a much higher level of correlation to traditional assets as markets have broadly recovered. We thought it timely to update our analysis and present our findings to investors.</p>
<p class="">More recently, crypto assets are once again decoupling from equities as Bitcoin explodes to yearly highs above US$13,000 while the major US and Australian indices stagnate. We expect this decreasing correlation to continue as retail and institutional focus continues to turn towards crypto assets.</p>
<p class="">The aftermath of the coronavirus market panic has been nothing short of extraordinary. It took less than 2 and a half months for the NASDAQ Composite to reclaim it’s all time high after falling over 30% peak-to-trough. During this time, Bitcoin and crypto assets experienced a similar V- shaped recovery as markets became confident that the US Federal Reserve would do everything in its power to support markets.</p>
<p class="">In March we witnessed a synchronised global flight to cash, from April onwards we witnessed a synchronised global flight to risk assets.</p>

<p class="">In previous blog posts on crypto correlations, we compared traditional assets to a hypothetical portfolio of the major crypto assets. The above graph shows the 12 month rolling correlation between the performance of the Apollo Capital Fund and the performance of Australian Equities, Australian Bonds and Gold.</p>
<p class="">The Fund’s correlation to Australian equities has been increasing significantly from March 2020 to present, this is likely attributable to coronavirus’s impact on global markets. We believe that this high level of correlation is unlikely to continue as the crypto asset market develops.</p>
<p class="">Before COVID-19 the Fund had a small positive correlation with all three of these assets classes. However, since May of 2020 the Apollo Capital Fund has been increasingly uncorrelated to both Australian Bonds and Gold.</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">The relatively high correlation between the fund’s returns and equities is largely a result of the increased correlation experienced after the coronavirus sell off. Unsurprisingly, the fund has demonstrated little correlation to Australian Bonds, International Bonds and Gold. Crypto assets and equities are also fundamentally different, but their recent correlation is a result of the ‘risk on’ attitude that was prevalent in the weeks following the initial market panic.</p>
<p class="">While the Fund maintains a high correlation to the performance of Bitcoin, our allocation to various high quality crypto assets has seen the Fund outperform Bitcoin by 73.7% since the start of the year.</p>
<p class="">At Apollo Capital, we believe there is a strong argument for a small allocation to crypto assets within a broader portfolio. Crypto assets have demonstrated that they are not out of reach in a broad market sell off. However, the future is bright as an independent asset that will continue to be impacted by different market forces to traditional asset classes.</p>

<p class="">This article is co-authored by Tim Johnston, Managing Director of Apollo Capital and Michael Armitage, Principal of Fundlab</p>
<p class="">Markets are fascinating. The current macroeconomic backdrop is especially interesting. Not only are we in the middle of a decades-long global money printing experiment, we are in the middle of a severe global pandemic that threatens the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Many global economies are in recessions. And yet as investors, we continually ask ourselves, where to from here?</p>
<p class="">At Apollo Capital we have the privilege of speaking to a wide variety of investors, from high net worth individuals, to family offices and small institutional investors. At times it appears no one is bullish on any asset class. Below, we consider the outlook for the traditional asset classes: equities, bonds and real estate. Australian investors will need to work harder and smarter than they have previously. The time for simply being levered long real estate and long equities has passed.</p>
<p class=""><em>Please note, the below is not investment advice. The consideration of these asset classes is simply a high level description of how we view the current state of traditional assets. Please do your own research, form your own conclusions and by all means, let us know if your view differs.</em></p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Equities</strong></p>
<p class="">We believe an outlook on equities involves reconciling two competing forces: valuations and global money printing.</p>
<p class="">First, valuations. From the investors we speak to, it is hard to come to any conclusion other than valuations of equity markets are stretched. That’s putting it diplomatically. Some valuations are ludicrous. The chart below is the historical Price Earnings (PE) Ratio for the Australian All Ords Index. We can see that the market’s PE ratio did not even revert to its long term average when markets were first impacted by Covid-19 in March. As markets have recovered, so has the average PE ratio, trending back to elevated levels.</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">The current PE Ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is around 28 and is significantly higher than average. The valuations of many tech stocks are astronomical.</p>
<p class="">Shopify is one example of the extreme valuations placed on leading technology companies. Shopify recently announced second quarter financial performance. Total revenue for the second quarter was $714.3m, GMV was $30.1 billion and operating income was $300,000. Annualised, those numbers are revenue $2.8bn, GMV around $120bn and operating income $1.2m. Shopify as a whole is valued at around $116bn, meaning Price to GMV is around 1, Price to Revenue is around 41 and the Price to Earnings is around 1,160. These are incredible numbers! Investors are clearly pricing in a huge amount of growth.</p>
<p class="">While it may not be fair to analyse one stock in isolation, tech stocks are increasingly leading global equity markets. Perhaps this time is different &#8211; valuations of companies, especially technology companies have been high for a long time, and investors have generated strong returns investing into already expensive technology stocks. Then again, if you’ve <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/This-Time-Different-Centuries-Financial/dp/0691152640">read the book</a>, this time is never different.</p>
<p class="">An investor would be brave to bet against equities, both global and domestic. We believe equities are largely being propped up by the flood of liquidity from global central banks. This new paradigm has been the case for a number of years, equities have been expensive for a long time now, yet they have continued to become more expensive, culminating in one of the longest bull markets in history.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Bonds</strong></p>
<p class="">We believe the outlook for bonds and fixed interest is negative. Bonds appreciate in periods of falling interest rates. Interest rates have been falling for a very long time and are arguably at ground zero. Some longer dated government bonds are trading at negative rates, meaning investors are not receiving any interest. Rather, they are paying to receive the notional amount in the future. These investors are of the view that rates will decrease further into negative territory.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Real Estate</strong></p>
<p class="">We are bearish on commercial real estate and neutral on residential real estate. We predict commercial property will suffer from a decades-long shift from centralised working in CBDs to flexible remote working conditions. We were already seeing the start of this trend which has been dramatically accelerated as Covid-19 has impacted our lives. The surveys are clear &#8211; workers prefer to work from home. Assuming your average worker would prefer to work from home 2 to 3 days a week, we question whether that will lead to a 40-60% reduction in demand for commercial real estate. It might not be that simple, a worker might still need a space, even if they are not using it, but we believe the writing is on the wall for commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="">Australian investors have amassed vast amounts of wealth from being levered long residential real estate over the past 30 years. Australian investors love property, but we think the love story is coming to an end due to the bottoming out of interest rates. Australian property investors have benefitted from falling interest rates for nearly 30 years. While property has seemed expensive for a very long time, the ability to service mortgage repayments has eased dramatically. While it can be difficult to buy into the market, once investors have bought in, interest rates have fallen, investors find it easier to pay off their mortgage, their house inevitably appreciates, they believe property is a high return, low risk investment and they rinse and repeat. This cannot go on forever. Australian property may benefit as mortgage interest rates decline to reach the same levels as our global mortgage rates (around 1-2%). However, residential real estate investors would be brave to expect the same returns over the next 30 years as we have seen over the previous 30 years.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Opportunity Cost</strong></p>
<p class="">With a bleak outlook for traditional asset classes, investors must consider where to from here? Some will increase their allocations to defensive assets like cash and government bonds. Many have and will increase demand for alternative assets like gold and crypto assets. We ask investors &#8211; what is the opportunity cost of allocating to crypto assets? What are investors foregoing by shaving one or two points from traditional assets in favour of crypto assets? We believe the opportunity cost is low. In return, investors gain exposure to an area showing promising growth that is uncorrelated to traditional assets.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">&#8212;</p>
<p class="">The main reason investors would shun crypto assets is risk. Crypto assets are volatile, the technology is young and there is a not insignificant risk of permanent loss of capital. Let’s flip the question around &#8211; what are the risks in traditional assets? With stretched valuations in equity markets, a bleak macroeconomic outlook and global interest rates at ground zero, perhaps investors are underestimating the risks in equities, bonds and real estate. When analysing the risk of traditional assets, the low opportunity cost of investing in crypto assets, their uncorrelated nature and enormous growth potential, the prospects of crypto assets looks increasingly favourable. The question then becomes which investors are prepared to work harder, do the research and take on the reputation and professional risk associated with suggesting such an allocation.</p>

<p class="">In a sideways market is is easier to see the differences in performance between these assets very clearly. It should be noted that top 10 is not our investment universe at all. In fact from the list above the only two assets we hold are Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p class="">The above tables gives us a sense of the huge performance differences between crypto assets, but it doesn’t tell us the whole story.</p>
<p class="">One way to systematically look at the market is in different sector or <em>verticals</em>. Indeed, if you’re an investor in our fund you would have seen this type of sector break-up in our Quarterly Letters. We should further note that within these verticals we can further divide the space in sub-categories. For example within Decentralised Finance (DeFi), you have Lending, DEXes, Stablecions, Synthetic assets and so on.</p>
<p class="">This is the average performance of some different verticals year-to-date compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum:</p>

<p class="">Above charts clearly shows the breakout performance of DeFi in 2020. This is also evident looking at the metric Total Value Locked in DeFi as reported by <a href="https://defipulse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi Pulse</a> which just surpassed US$1.5bn, a new all time high. What does it mean that the Median performance is lower than the Average performance above? To us, it indicates that you will want a relatively broad exposure to the credible assets within a sector.

<p class="">We ofter reiterate that indexing just doesn’t make sense crypto. The reason is that outside Bitcoin, everything else is more akin to VC investing where most projects will ultimately fail. We believe investing in assets that are credible within well defined market segments will deliver superior returns for our investors. Just take a look at the first table in this article again. If you would have indexed the top ten on Feb 1, 2018 your portfolio would have been down 76%. That’s very hard to recover from. By systematically combining top-down with bottom-up analysis within verticals we have significantly outperformed an indexing strategy.</p>

<p class="">Crypto assets are unlike any other asset class. They are unique, independent and are largely driven by a different investor-base. In theory, crypto assets should not correlate with other assets like equities and bonds. The data backs up this theory, most of the time.</p>
<p class="">Crypto assets have not been tested in a broad-based market sell off, like a GFC or dot-com crash. Crypto assets were not around during past major equities crashes. In fact, since crypto assets were born, equity markets have enjoyed an almost uninterrupted bull run.</p>
<p class="">This has now ended. With the devastating impact of the Coronavirus on our community and economy, equity markets have crashed. The ASX is down around 30% and has seen unprecedented volatility in the past two weeks of trading. Where typically a large move on the ASX was around 1.5%, in the past 2 weeks of trading, the market’s daily fluctuations have been between 3% and 7%.</p>
<p class="">The question becomes whether the theory that crypto assets are independent and uncorrelated will hold during the realities of market crashes.</p>
<p class="">The early signals appear mixed.</p>
<p class="">On the 12th of March crypto prices fell around 40%. This was disappointing as crypto assets had been holding up well since the Coronavirus news started impacting equity markets. As Henrik reported last week, this crash looks to be attributable to general market panic and the forced unwinding of leveraged positions on futures exchanges. When markets panic, investors flock to cash. Crypto assets were not spared.</p>
<p class="">Below is the rolling monthly correlations of crypto assets to equities, bonds and gold, from an Australian investor’s perspective:</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">The graph above can be divided into two sections: before “Feb-20” and after “Feb-20”. Before “Feb-20”, crypto assets exhibited no meaningful correlation to other assets. While there might be periods of temporary correlation, we have previously demonstrated that over longer timeframes, crypto assets do not correlate with other assets.  After “Feb-20”, around the time Coronavirus hit markets, we note that crypto assets start to positively correlate with equities and gold, and negatively correlate with bonds. The data backs up our observations that crypto assets have performed in a similar fashion to gold and equities.</p>
<p class="">After markets initially panic, the dust settles and investors ask, where to from here? For crypto asset investors, will the theory of an independent, uncorrelated asset hold?</p>
<p class="">Recent market movements show that crypto assets are starting to decouple from equities. Late last week we saw ‘green shoots’ of the crypto asset safe haven theory. Crypto prices shot up over 20%, while other assets continue to be volatile. Last night, crypto assets surged upwards around 7%, while the S&amp;P 500 closed down around 3%.</p>
<p class="">We don’t know where markets will go from here. If equity markets continue to fall, on one hand crypto assets might correlate and fall with them, in which case investors would probably be no worse off than if they remained in equities. On the other hand, there is a reasonable chance that crypto assets might continue to decouple from equities and we see the blue line in the graph above return towards 0.</p>
<p class="">Given the uncertainty, we believe there is a very strong case for a small allocation to crypto assets. We believe there is a strong chance the theory will hold.</p>
<p class="">In portfolios comprising large holdings of stocks, bonds and even gold, we ask, why wouldn’t you have a small allocation to crypto assets? They might prove a valuable hedge in these uncertain times.</p>

<p class="">The consequence of the lockdowns following the spread of the virus has lead central banks around the world to take unprecedented action. The Federal Reserve on Sunday cut their policy rate to near zero in addition to other easing measures. Notably ECB already had -0.5% policy rate entering this crises and probably won’t cut any further. As the stock markets around the world have panicked, we have seen a run on liquid assets that have performed relatively well. This includes Gold and Bitcoin. We saw the same pattern in the ’08 financial crises when Gold initially sold off to meet margin calls before entering a multi-year bull market. That was just before Bitcoin was born. We believe Bitcoin and crypto is a hedge against a monetary policy with unlimited money supply. Remember, Bitcoin’s supply is cut come May — this is the exact opposite monetary policy of central banks!</p>
<p>One difference between crypto markets and other markets is the lack of circuit breakers and stops in crypto markets. Crypto markets operate 24/7 and even if they’re down (or up!) a very high percentage they continue to relentlessly operate. This is unlike traditional markets that halt trading during these kind of events. This likely means that a true market/clearing price is found more effectively in crypto markets as they are quicker react, always trade and never halt trading. There are no external actors manipulating crypto markets.</p>
<p>Last Friday, crypto markets saw a large drop, this seems to have been exacerbated by liquidations of leveraged traders particularly on one exchange, BitMEX. When the dust had settled it looks like around US$700M worth of positions had been liquidated on BitMEX alone. Crypto futures went from trading at contango to backwardation (futures trading below spot price). <a href="https://twitter.com/skewdotcom/status/1238428787865460736?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This</a> is a good thread describing what happened on Friday. On the bright side, after Friday’s move, a lot of leveraged traders have been flushed out of the crypto market. In an encouraging sign of stabilisation, in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin is trading unchanged around the US$5,000 mark, while the US stock markets had its biggest fall since 1987, -12%.</p>
<p class="">The whole Decentralised Financed (DeFi) system on Ethereum came under stress last week. Bots fighting to move coins created a backlog on Ethereum which resulted in very high ‘gas prices’. In other words the Ethereum network had a hard time handling all the traffic. To us this shows how active the DeFi network really is. Yes it needs to be upgraded to handle higher traffic in situations like this. As things are calming down, it seems it mostly came out of it unscathed.</p>
<p>For investors looking for an equity portfolio hedge, we have a hard time to find other assets with upside potential outside of Gold and Crypto. Saying that, we do recognise that both Gold and Crypto have been terrible hedges so far in this environment but were are less than 1 month since the peak in what has the potential to become a multi-year event. The classic hedge, bonds, appears to us to have limited upside with interest rates at all time lows. To that point, we like to point out they are at a 3,000 year low, since interest rates were invented.</p>
<p>Our strategy during this time is to opportunistically take advantage of misallocations in the markets. As an example, right now it is possible, with less than 60 days to Bitcoin’s halvening and with Bitcoin at around US$5,000, to buy Bitcoin at a discount to spot prices through futures. We are taking advantage of such opportunities including selective short opportunities while remaining constructive about the market. Our cash position is healthy and even though the month of March looks like it will be a tough month for us performance-wise, we are excited about the future of crypto and our portfolio in this new macro environment.</p>
<p class="">We are big fans of the expert in tail risk, Nassim Nicholas Taleb. He famously says: “Never ask anyone for their opinion, forecast, or recommendation. Just ask them what they have — or don’t have — in their portfolio.”</p>
<p>While everyone’s financial circumstances are different, and this should certainly not be taken as financial advice, for the first time I have no stocks, only cash, gold and crypto in my portfolio.</p>

<p class="">In <em>The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography, </em>Simon Singh takes the reader on a journey through the history of encryption. He traces the evolution of cryptography and details its dramatic effects on wars, nations and individual lives. In reading <em>The Code Book</em>, it becomes clear that throughout history, there has been a constant tension between codemakers and codebreakers. At times, the codebreakers have had the upper hand. Other times it has been the codemakers.</p>
<p class="">The codemakers are currently winning the battle. Current encryption methods appear impregnable, successfully securing our online transactions, data and messages. Popular messaging services like WhatsApp offer “end-to-end encryption”, meaning messages can only be seen by the sender and receiver. If a message were to be intercepted, it is nearly impossible to decrypt. While words like “cryptography” and “encryption” often attract sinister connotations, they are used more widely and more positively than people might think.</p>
<p class="">Crypto assets are governed and protected by cryptography. Indeed, “crypto assets” are so-called as they are based on cryptography. Crypto assets combine knowledge of several academic fields including mathematics, computer science, finance and cryptography.</p>
<p class="">Cryptography is fundamental to the security and operation of crypto assets. And that cryptography is very strong. We like this infographic which shows the likelihood of cracking a Bitcoin private key.</p>

<p class="">While modern day codemakers have the upper hand on codebreakers, what are the threats to this position? Will quantum computing be the secret weapon of the codebreakers? Could this affect the security of crypto assets?</p>
<p class="">
<strong>Quantum Computing</strong></p>
<p class="">Quantum computers are powerful machines that are an order of magnitude more powerful than today’s most advanced computers. Without delving into the detail, quantum computing allows computers to work through problems by performing calculations in parallel, rather than sequentially.</p>
<p class="">Google has claimed “quantum supremacy” over the most powerful supercomputers in the world, by solving a problem considered virtually unsolvable for modern day computers. It’s quantum computer, called Sycamore, has claimed to have completed a complex calculation in 200 seconds. The same calculation would take the world’s most powerful supercomputers 10,000 years.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class=""><strong>Threats to Crypto Assets</strong></p>
<p class="">It is impossible to predict how technology will evolve. It is tempting and attention grabbing to make wild predictions, but we will focus on what we know.</p>
<p class="">Blockchain networks appear safe. Blockchain ledgers are distributed to thousands of participants. It is impossible to simultaneously alter everyone’s copy of the record.  No data block can be removed or modified without affecting all other blocks, requiring consensus.</p>
<p class="">Quantum computing might pose as a threat to public key cryptography, the backbone of blockchain security. Put simply, incredibly powerful quantum computers might change the equations in the image above.</p>
<p class="">Many experts believe the threat of quantum computing will arise in the next ten to 15 years. The preceding paragraph applies assuming quantum computing advances, but cryptography stands still. Today’s quantum computers exist only in the lab. Accordingly, the codemakers are adapting with proposed countermeasures in the form of quantum-proof cryptography. By the time quantum computers are available to the wider public, it is reasonable to expect that most cryptocurrencies will have already made the leap into a quantum-resistance movement.</p>
<p class="">
<strong>—</strong></p>
<p class=""><em>The Code Book</em> by Simon Singh has at least one clear lesson: encryption methods are safe, until they are not. Codemakers have throughout history developed impregnable encryption methods, to realise that they are in fact breakable. Leading cryptographers and crypto asset projects will need to stay on top of these developments. However, perhaps unlike previous users of cryptography throughout history, with a market value of a quarter of a trillion dollars, the bounty on the security of crypto assets, and the value that needs to be protected, might be historically unprecedented.</p>
