<p><strong>Decentralised Autonomous Organisations</strong></p>
<p class="">An exciting phenomenon in the crypto world that is currently accelerating is the transition from a central hierarchical structured entity (Web2.0) to a decentralised and flat structured entity (Web3.0). This business structure created as a result is called a Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAO). Although DAOs are yet to fully mature (as are most sectors such as DeFi, NFTs and Blockchain gaming), their benefits over traditional structures are starting to be identified: transparency, immutability, autonomous functionality, and democratic voting for decision making. Many of the great crypto projects are moving to more decentralised modes of governance outlined in one of our previous blog posts <a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2020/3/10/the-race-for-decentralisation">The Race for Decentralisation.</a></p>

<p><strong>What is a DAO?</strong></p>
<p class="">As mentioned above, a DAO is a completely decentralised governance model that an entity will operate under. The following analogy helps explain the concept of a DAO. As Bitcoin was designed as a peer-to-peer currency that removes the middlemen in financial transactions, DAOs are designed as self-efficient entities with all business processes written in the code, thereby eliminating managerial involvement. Examples of DAO business types include; for-profit and non-profits, investor groups, trader groups, Dapp communities, developer teams, DeFi protocol governance bodies, NFT or art collector groups, and many more.</p>
<p><strong>How do DAOs operate?</strong></p>
<p class="">DAOs are created under a predefined set of rules; these rules are encoded as smart contracts and sit autonomously on the Internet. From time to time, a DAO will also need external intervention in order to perform tasks it can not perform autonomously. These external interventions are performed by trusted users in the DAO’s ecosystem, these trusted users can be project founders or publicly elected ‘officials’. These officials are elected by governance token holders to perform such functions.</p>
<p class="">Once the rules are established, a DAO enters a funding phase. The funding and distribution of ownership (in the form of tokens) is an essential part for two reasons. Firstly, a DAO has to have some internal property, tokens that can be spent by the organisation or used to reward certain activities within it. Secondly, by investing in a DAO, users get voting rights and subsequently influence the way it operates.</p>
<p class="">Everyone who bought a stake in a DAO can make improvement proposals for the DAO, creating a democracy for innovative ideas. Furthermore, seeing as DAO transactions and interactions with other protocols or individuals are all recorded on the blockchain, they have 100% transparency, a trait that is relatively uncommon in Web2.0 generation entities.</p>

<h4>Apollo Portfolio DAO Examples</h4>
<p><strong>Yearn Finance (YFI)</strong></p>
<p class="">The Yearn Finance DAO presents a fascinating case study in how the structure of an active DAO can change over time to facilitate greater operational efficiency and increase value to token holders. Since the approval of <a href="https://yearn.snapshot.page/#/ybaby.eth/proposal/QmSMyYeKrRpnA7Xn56o2NtbCUzxmhzCupL7LxMA1reXxq4">YIP-61: Governance 2.0</a> in late April 2021, Yearn has been transitioning into a multi-DAO structure in order for the protocol development to not be stifled by bureaucracy while maintaining a sufficient level of decentralisation.</p>
<p class="">Multi-DAO refers to the fluid number of DAO’s that contribute to the protocol in some unique way, in the Yearn governance structure these groups consist of YFI holders (vote on changes to the protocol and governance structure), yTeams (focus on relevant operations) and the Multisig (execute any on-chain decisions &amp; transactions). Synthetix are an early innovator of the Multi-DAO architecture, their success is likely to have prompted Yearn Finance to follow a similar path.</p>
<p class="">Each yTeam of the Yearn Finance DAO have objectives and discrete powers as defined by the token holders. Examples of yTeams and their powers include yDev (YFI protocol developers), yFarm (Responsible for growing the treasury), yBudget (Spend protocol funds productively) &amp; yTx (Write transactions for the Multisig to eventually act upon). A comprehensive summary of Yearn’s governance and yTeams <a href="https://docs.yearn.finance/governance/governance-and-operations">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tracer DAO (TCR)</strong></p>
<p class="">In June 2021, <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/meet-the-defi-developers-who-ve-raised-funds-for-a-derivatives-system-20210628-p5850t">Brisbane based Tracer DAO raised US$4.5 million</a> from leading funds and angel investors in the crypto space, including Apollo Capital. The Tracer DAO will be governed by TCR token holders and utilise a diverse selection of ‘initial governors’ to streamline governance in the protocol’s early stages. These governors hold expertise in smart contracts, market making, DeFi protocols, Ethereum layer 2’s, user interface design and more.</p>
<p class="">We view Tracer’s ‘DAO first approach’ as optimal for venture capitalists in the crypto markets as it facilitates a streamlined and practical approach to governance over a purely digital asset (the Ethereum based derivatives platform that Tracer DAO is developing). We look forward to providing further analysis of Tracer DAO’s derivatives platform in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Synthetix Protocol (SNX)</strong></p>
<p class="">The Synthetix protocol is another portfolio position that has been at the forefront of DAO innovation over the past several years. Synthetix is an early pioneer of the multiDAO structure, the success of Synthetix governance has prompted similar protocols such as Yearn Finance to implement a similar approach, as discussed earlier. The Synthetix Protocol has several key governing bodies and artifacts (Synthetix Improvement Proposals) which co-exist to enable the decentralised nature of the Protocol. The key decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) are the Spartan Council, Protocol DAO, Synthetic DAO, Ambassadors DAO and the Grants DAO.</p>
<p class="">The most important DAO in the Synthetix governance structure is the Spartan Council (SC), this governing DAO currently comprises 8 members who are elected for a duration of time by SNX staking participants. The Spartan Council has a relatively significant amount of control when compared to more traditional DAO structures but this level of control allows for greater operational efficiency and satisfies the governance demands of the SNX token holders.</p>

<p><strong>NFT DAO Example &#8211; PleasrDAO</strong></p>
<p class="">In March 2021, the auctioning of <a href="https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1">pplpleasr’s</a><a href="https://foundation.app/@pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623">Uniswap V3 teaser video</a> for charity culminated in the last minute creation of one of the most unique DAO’s in the crypto space. The PleasrDAO was formed and funded in under 36 hours and proceeded to buy the up-and-coming digital animator’s NFT for 310 ETH (US$525,000 at the time). PleasrDAO was funded by well known project founders &amp; investors and continues to acquire high-end digital art. <a href="https://thedefiant.io/i-thought-i-was-living-in-a-simulation-the-story-behind-the-500k-uniswap-nft/">The story of PleasrDAO</a> demonstrates the trustless and permissionless possibilities of DAO’s in the acquisition and ownership of digital assets.</p>

<div id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1626749096576_27537" class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2">
<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class="">We view DAOs as a paradigm shift in organisation architecture that allows for greater transparency, immutability, alignment of stakeholder interests and value capture for underlying token holders. DAOs allow digital assets to be controlled and maintained by a large community of decentralised stakeholders in an open and permissionless manner. This innovation has been made possible by the technological breakthroughs of blockchain, smart contracts and crypto assets. Our portfolio consists of DAOs that are at the forefront of this innovation and we look forward to tracking DAO developments in the years to come.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Forks</strong></p>
<p class="">Similarly to most successful software products, crypto assets require iterations to the code to:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Fix issues and bugs in code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Add new functionality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Increase performance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="">In software, we see this done via downloadable software updates. In the open-source world of crypto, this is done via a process called &#8216;Forking&#8217;. As ‘Layer One’ crypto assets are primarily decentralised, they require all the active participants in the network that can be referred to as &#8220;nodes&#8221; (miners &amp; validators) to follow the same specific set of rules to function. These sets of regulations combine to be known as the network&#8217;s &#8220;Protocol&#8221;. A Protocol will typically define the following constraints for the blockchain:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Block-size (MBs) on the blockchain that is for mined/validated in the mem pool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The size of the miners’ reward and how it is distributed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The hardware required for running nodes or mining rigs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The mechanism for how consensus in the network is reached (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/">PoW</a>, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">PoS</a>, <a href="http://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/a-brief-introduction-to-hybrid-powpos-consensus-mechanism">Hybrid</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Entitlements for native token holders/participants</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Soft Fork vs Hard Fork</strong></p>
<p class="">As mentioned above, &#8216;Forking&#8217; is a mechanism for updating a &#8216;Layer One&#8217; crypto-asset protocol. It occurs by creating a new chain that is &#8216;branched&#8217; from the original. The branched blockchain is termed the &#8216;Fork&#8217;, and a new protocol will then govern this blockchain. There are two distinct methods. A ‘Layer One’ asset can be forked, either by a &#8220;Hard Fork&#8221; or a &#8220;Soft Fork&#8221;. Details of both are listed below:</p>
<p class="">A &#8216;Soft Fork&#8217; is a change to the network that is &#8216;backwards compatible&#8217;, meaning old nodes that were running before the change will still be able to participate (update to) the new change, as long as they abide by the new subset of rules. If the non-upgraded nodes produce blocks that do not abide by the new set of rules they will not be recognised.</p>

<p class="">A &#8216;Hard Fork&#8217; changes the network so that it is non-compatible with its original network protocol. All un-updated node transactions will not be valid on the new chain rendering it in-computable on the new forked chain until configured properly. A necessary consequence of a hard fork is the duplication of all previous transactions and balances carried onto the new chain. &#8216;Hard Forks&#8217; can be controversial or non-contentious.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Controversial Forks</strong></p>
<p class="">Suppose the &#8216;Hard Fork&#8217; is controversial, meaning the fork results from opposing ideals from developers. In that case, the newly created fork will duplicate all the previous transactions and wallet balances from the original chain. The first block after the fork will now record a brand new version of the crypto asset native to the forked chain. Any developer can fork an open-source blockchain; however, the strength of that fork compared to the original networks will depend on participation from new and existing communities. Two examples of controversial hard forks are; the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork and the Ethereum Classic (ETC) to Ethereum (ETH) fork.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Bitcoin Cash Fork </strong></p>
<p class="">The BCH fork occurred in August 2017 and was due to a subset of developers wanting to increase Bitcoin&#8217;s block size. This change was designed to increase Bitcoin&#8217;s efficiency as a peer to peer currency by allowing more transactions per block. Today 1 BCH is worth 1.45% of a Bitcoin, which is a steep drop from its previous all-time high, which saw a ratio of 26.2% in December of 2017. One of the main causes for the substantial decline is illustrated in our previous blog post ‘<a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2018/11/20/how-the-bitcoin-cash-splitnbspunfolded">How the Bitcoin Cash Split Unfolded</a>’. As most of the Bitcoin community favoured keeping block sizes smaller, Bitcoin Cash is now considered a less successful &#8216;Layer One&#8217; crypto asset to Bitcoin. This sentiment expressed by the community is why we now refer to the most significant crypto-asset globally as a store of value asset, with many coining it as &#8216;Digital Gold&#8217;.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Ethereum Fork </strong></p>
<p class="">Ethereum (ETH) was created due to a hard fork. In this instance, Ethereum Classic (ETC) was not the forked chain but the original Ethereum chain. This fork resulted from the core developers&#8217; response to the original Ethereum being hacked in the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists">&#8216;The DAO Attack&#8217;</a>. Instead of allowing the hackers the $60M in Ether of what was currently the mainchain, they forked the chain off and restored the lost funds to the victims of the attack on the forked chain. The portion of the community that retained the original log of transactions and balances from The DAO hack did not upgrade the software and continues on the original network, Ethereum Classic.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Non-Contentious Hard Fork</strong></p>
<p class="">A &#8216;Non-Contentious Hard Fork&#8217; is designed to implement protocol upgrades. These will likely have been stated on a project&#8217;s roadmap since their inception or, in Ethereum&#8217;s case, after switching the consensus method to Proof of Stake (PoS). A planned hard fork looks to upgrade and enhance the blockchain&#8217;s capabilities and features. As a result, the entire community, spearheaded by the core developers, will transition to the upgraded version of the blockchain.</p>
<p class="">An example of a less contentious hard fork (a minority of miners have been opposed to it) is Ethereum&#8217;s &#8216;London&#8217; due on the 4th of August, block 12965000. The &#8216;London&#8217; fork is part of Ethereum&#8217;s multi-phase upgrade plan as the network progresses to 100% Proof of Work and &#8220;Sharding&#8217; as a scalability solution. Ethereum&#8217;s &#8216;London&#8217; fork will introduce the following five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to the protocol:</p>

<p class="">There is currently a race for decentralisation going on in the crypto industry. The reasons are multifold, but at the core is the key value proposition of blockchains: the ability for them to be trustless, permissionless and censorship resistant ultimately hinges on decentralisation.</p>
<p class="">More specifically, let’s look at decentralisation for two pressing reasons: security and regulation.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p class="">Perhaps this is no where as clear as in IOTA. This crypto asset is still up ~42% year to date, despite being a centralised train wreck. In fact it’s mainnet is offline — turned off by their Foundation.</p>

<p class="">Not only is IOTA up heavily this year but it is also in the top 30 of crypto assets with a market cap of $630M. When we get asked ‘do you invest in the top crypto assets?’, we are not shy about the fact that we avoid most of them.</p>
<p class="">So in IOTA there is a central party that simply can turn off the network by disabling something called the ‘Coordinator’.</p>
<p class="">In some smart contract systems, the developers have the potential to upgrade the system. This potentially has very grave security concerns as funds can be stolen when the rules of those contracts change. In DeFi-projects like Compound, Uniswap and Augur, the developers don’t have that upgradability ability — those protocols are decentralised to a point where they are unstoppable. Early on in a project we understand that there could be a need to upgrade things along the way — but those projects should race for decentralisation. It can be a gradual process, but it needs to be a major focus.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Regulatory capture</strong></p>
<p class="">In my interview with Kain Warwick, the founder of Synthetix it was clear that they are looking to get rid of their foundation in Singapore as soon as possible and move to a decentralised autonomous organisation, a DAO.</p>
<p class="">A corporation or a foundation is a centralised entity that can be targeted by regulators or lawmakers, it’s a risk for developers, shareholders and ultimately users of a particular protocol. SEC has made clear that protocols need a sufficient level of decentralisation not to be deemed securities. Bitcoin doesn’t have a CEO and its founder chose not to become public for good reasons — it is, according to regulator, sufficiently decentralised.</p>
<p class="">One of my predictions for 2020 is the proliferation of DAOs. This is a way yo handle governance through crypt tokens. Instead of incorporating a legal entity most of the same things can be done in a decentralised manner through token economics. The latest project to move in this direction is Compound.</p>

<p class="">They started off and still are a for-profit company with world-class investors as shareholders such as Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital. The Compound governance token will be distributed to shareholders on a pro-rata basis. What I believe ultimately will happen is that all value will be captured in their native token. Shareholders will make their shares worthless — because a truly decentralised protocol is worth so much more.</p>
<p class="">There is a race for decentralisation. That shouldn’t come as a surprise, because what is the point of using blockchains if they are not decentralised? Remember, blockchains are slow and complex compared to centralised services.</p>
<p class="">Security and Regulatory capture are top of mind when it comes to decentralisation and we expect DAOs to proliferate in this brave new world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain by a group of miners controlling more than 50% of the network&#8217;s mining hashrate, or computing power. The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could double-spend coins.</p>
<p>This is happening on smaller networks. Be careful. Chief Investment Officer Henrik Andersson shares his thoughts.</p>
