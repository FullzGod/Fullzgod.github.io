										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2021 was an incredible year for crypto with new all time highs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as many other assets. We also saw corporations and institutions support crypto like never before. The first Bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US and here in Australia we saw the country’s largest bank, CBA start offering crypto assets to their clients. If 2020 was the year of DeFi, 2021 saw a boom in the NFT market.</p>
<p>It’s incredibly hard to predict what will happen in the fast moving crypto markets, but here are my best bets for 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling</strong></p>
<p>2022 will be the year of scaling Ethereum. Together with alternative Layer 1s, my prediction is that Ethereum Layer 1 will become less than 50% of total DeFi TVL in 2022. By the end of 2022, the majority of TVL will be on Ethereum Layer 2s and alternative L1s. This would be a huge shift in the market, accelerated by the launch of L2 tokens on Arbitrum and Optimism. For the first time blockchains will be able to onboard 100s of millions of users.</p>
<p><strong>DeFi/Derivatives</strong></p>
<p>While the general market rallied in 2021, a surprising number of DeFi assets underperformed, some even posting negative fiat denominated returns for the full year. I think we will see a resurgence in DeFi assets in 2022 partly helped by scaling that will enable things like on-chain derivatives to a much larger extent. My prediction is for $1 trillion in DeFi TVL by the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Chain</strong></p>
<p>2021 was the year that cemented the thesis that we are moving into a multi-chain world. Infrastructure projects enabling this future, things like multi-chain DEXes and bridges will significantly increase in a value in 2022. My prediction is that we will see at least one of these multi-chain infrastructure projects enter the top 20 most valuable crypto assets.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Headwinds</strong></p>
<p>We didn’t see much regulatory developments in 2021. Perhaps the biggest development was the approval of the first Bitcoin ETF in the US (unfortunately futures based). My prediction is that we will see negative regulatory developments out of the US in 2022. Influential senators like Elizabeth Warren (who eg Ryan Selkis of Messari refers to as Satan) has recently expressed deeply flawed and negative bias against crypto. My hope is that any negative development out of the US will not spill over to the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Web3/Metaverse</strong></p>
<p>A mega-trend in 2021 was NFTs going mainstream. Currently, NFT are mostly used for art, collectibles and for in-game items. All these ares will continue to grow rapidly. Another potentially huge growth area of NFTs is the metaverse. My prediction is that we will see another mega corporation, the likes of a Google or Apple, follow Meta (formerly Facebook) and launch products/services to support metaverse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2021 Predictions Review </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>1</em></strong><em>. We will see the rise of Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. While there has been much talk about Ethereum 2.0, it is still years away in the sense of being useable for smart contracts. I believe we will see some big DeFi protocols move to L2 in 2021 accompanied by real volumes. I hope that the community will come to a consensus over which solution to use, be it Optimistic Rollups or something else, but that is probably wishing for too much.</em></p>
<p>We did see the launch of Ethereum L2s with support from mainstream protocols like Uniswap, Balancer, Synthetix etc. However we didn’t see significant TVL or usage on these L2 in 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.</strong> Coinbase will IPO on a major exchange such as the NYSE or Nasdaq. This event would bring a lot of attention to crypto and solidify Coinbase as the ‘Google’ (or is it IBM?) of crypto.</em></p>
<p>Coinbase did IPO in April of 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. </strong>Bitcoin will again see an all time high in 2021. My personal opinion is that Bitcoin could reach US$50,000-100,000 in this bull cycle. I believe this could happen in 2021.  Monetary policy will continue to pour cash into global economies throughout 2021 while the supply increase of Bitcoin has decreased to only 6.25 BTC per block or 1.7% supply inflation per year. This is a potent cocktail for the best performing asset in the world to continue to outperform.</em></p>
<p>This was spot on as Bitcoin hit an all time high above $68,000 in November of 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. </strong>We will see the rise of at least one trustless stablecoin. With trustless I mean a crypto backed stablecoin or an algorithmic stablecoin. I bet one of them will reach over 500M in market cap in 2021. </em></p>
<p>2021 was a huge year for trustless stablecoins. TerraUSD got 10bn in market cap, MIM 4.5 bn, Frax 1.9bn, Liquity USD 833M and Fei USD 762M. At Apollo, we continue to be mega-bullish trustless stablecoins.</p>
<p><em><strong>5.</strong> Finally, I predict Cardano will fall out of top 10 crypto assets as defined by Coingecko. While Cardano is a far superior crypto asset to a lot of other assets out there, the top 10 is still very inefficient and will continue to change dramatically over time. In the case of Layer 1 smart contract platforms, the competition is getting very intense and I’d be surprised if Cardano will stay in its current position.</em></p>
<p>Cardano didn’t fall out of top 10, currently sitting at spot number 7. According to DeFiLlama Cardano has the highest market cap to TVL of any blockchain. I think market cap will go down faster than they will gain TVL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By Henrik Andersson，Apollo Capital 首选投资官 CIO</p>
<p>对加密货币而言，2021年是不可思议的一年。比特币、以太坊及许多其他加密资产的价格都创下历史新高。我们还看到，企业和机构在前所未有地支持加密货币。第一个比特币相关的ETF在美国获得批准，并且澳大利亚最大的银行CBA开始向客户提供加密资产服务。如果说2020年是DeFi之年，那么2021年则见证了NFT市场的繁荣。</p>
<p>虽然很难预测瞬息万变的加密市场将会发生什么，但我还是尽我所能对2022年做出预测。</p>
<p><strong>扩展性</strong><br />
2022年将是以太坊扩展性大为发展的一年。我认为，在2022年，以太坊Layer 1在DeFi 上的总锁定价值（TVL）将降至50%以下。到2022年底，大部分TVL将会基于以太坊的Layer 2链和其他Layer 1 区块链。这将是市场的巨大转变，并且在Arbitrum和Optimism上推出Layer 2代币，会进一步推动这种变化。区块链也将首次搭载上亿用户。</p>
<p><strong>DeFi/衍生品</strong><br />
尽管整个加密市场在2021年上行，但大量DeFi资产的表现不及预期，甚至一些资产全年的法币计价回报表现为负收益。我认为，我们将在2022年看到DeFi资产的复苏，这在一定程度上得益于以太坊的扩展性，而扩展性将使链上衍生品等DeFi应用在更大程度上得以落地。</p>
<p>我的预测是，到今年年底，DeFi TVL将达到1万亿美元。</p>
<p><strong>多链</strong><br />
2021年论证了我们正进入多链世界的这一观点。而实现多链的基础设施项目，如多链DEX（去中心化交易所）和跨链桥等项目的价值将在2022年显著上升。</p>
<p>我的预测是，至少有一个多链基础设施项目将位列最具价值的20个加密资产。</p>
<p><strong>监管的不利因素</strong><br />
在2021年，监管方面并无显著进展。或许最大的进展便是，美国首支比特币相关ETF获批。但遗憾的是，这只是比特币期货的ETF，而不是真正的比特币ETF。</p>
<p>我的预测是，美国对加密资产的监管在2022年会更加苛刻。Elizabeth Warren等有影响力的参议员最近表达了对加密货币的偏见及不认可。我希望，美国的任何负面政策将来不会波及到世界其他地区。</p>
<p><strong>Web 3/元宇宙</strong><br />
NFT走向主流世界，这是2021年的一大趋势。目前，NFT主要用于艺术品、收藏品和游戏道具。所有这些领域将继续迅速发展。而NFT的另一个潜在的巨大增长领域则是元宇宙。</p>
<p>我的预测是，我们将看到另一家巨头企业（如谷歌或苹果等）会追随Meta（即脸书）的脚步，推出支持Meta的产品或服务。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>2021 Predictions Review</strong><br />
回顾2021年的预测，准确率高达 80%</p>
<p><strong>预测1：</strong>我们将看到以太坊Layer 2解决方案的崛起。虽然关于以太坊2.0的讨论已经很多了，但要真正用于智能合约的平台，还需要几年的时间。</p>
<p>我相信，在2021年，一些大型DeFi协议将迁移到多个Layer 2链上，并拥有真正的用户流量。我希望加密社区能够就使用哪种解决方案达成共识，如Optimistic Rollups抑或是其他，但我的期望可能太高了。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>在2021年，我们确实看到了在主流协议如Uniswap、Balancer、Synthetix等的支持下，多个以太坊Layer 2链面世了。然而，Layer 2链并未拥有大量的TVL，而且这些协议也没有应用在Layer 2上。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测2</strong>：Coinbase将在纽交所或纳斯达克等主流交易所上市。这一事件将引起人们对加密货币的大量关注，也将巩固Coinbase作为加密货币领域“谷歌”或“IBM”的地位。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>Coinbase的确于2021年4月份上市。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测3：</strong>比特币将在2021年再次创下历史新高。我个人认为，在这个牛市周期中，比特币价格可能达到5 -10万美元。我相信这可能会在2021年实现。2021年全年，货币政策将继续印钞，用以刺激全球经济。而比特币供应量的增幅已降至每区块6.25 BTC，或者说其每年的供应通胀仅为1.7%。这是世界上表现最好的资产，并将继续跑赢大盘。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>比特币在2021年11月突破68000美元关口，创下历史新高。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测4：</strong>我们将看到至少一种无需信任的稳定币的崛起。我指的是加密货币支持的稳定币或算法稳定币。我敢打赌，到2021年，其中一家公司的市值将超过5亿美元。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>2021年对稳定币来说是重要的一年。TerraUSD的市值为100亿美元，MIM为45亿美元，Frax为19亿美元，LiquityUSD为8.33亿美元，FeiUSD为7.62亿美元。在Apollo，我们继续看涨稳定币。</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>预测5：</strong>Cardano将跌出Coingecko上十大加密货币资产的行列。尽管Cardano远胜于许多其他资产，但这所谓的前十排行榜依然不成熟，并将随着时间的推移而发生巨大变化。至于Layer 1智能合约平台，其竞争正变得愈加激烈。若Cardano仍能保持当前的排名，我会感到很惊讶。</p>
<p><strong>结果：</strong>Cardano并未跌出前十名，目前排名第七。根据DeFiLlama Cardano的数据，在所有区块链中，Cardano拥有最高的市值/TVL 比例。但我认为，其市值下跌的速度会比获取TVL的速度更快。</p>

The main value proposition for ‘store-of-value’ and non- fungible tokens is verifiable digital scarcity while DeFi is the clear market-fit for smart contracts.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Store-of-Value</strong></p>
<p class="">The first pillar of blockchain value is the store of value properties of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has become increasingly known as digital gold throughout it’s relatively short history, this narrative has become the key investment thesis of Bitcoin for distinguished and retail investors alike. Whilst we agree that the established comparison to gold is favourable, we view Bitcoin as an asset that’s potential stretches far beyond that of just a digital version of gold.</p>
<p class="">While the digital gold narrative was there from the very start of Bitcoin (its predecessor Bit Gold even had it in its name), it is a narrative that has grown in importance. Early on, Bitcoin was mainly known as a digital currency or digital cash that&#8217;s main value proposition came out of its usefulness as a non- sovereign and instant payment mechanism. After Bitcoin adoption reached a level where the demand for transactions resulted in relatively expensive transaction fees, this narrative became unfeasible and the investment thesis began to evolve into what it is today.</p>
<p class="">We believe that we are in the infant stages of the next evolution of Bitcoin’s widely accepted narrative. Bitcoin characteristics such as divisibility, transportability, flexibility and verifiability give the asset the potential to become more like a global reserve asset than digital gold. Key Drivers of this narrative are:</p>
<ol data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Continued corporate adoption by companies such as Tesla, Square and MicroStrategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Increased usefulness of Bitcoin as a payment mechanism made possible by the likes of PayPal, Visa &amp; Mastercard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Continued value destruction of fiat currencies caused by quantitative easing and low/negative interest rates.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p class=""><strong>Non-fungible tokens (NFT’s)</strong></p>
<p class="">Non-fungible tokens have the potential to bring blockchain technology to the financially agnostic masses. Non-fungible tokens are digital assets that represent a wide range of unique intangible items such as collectible sports cards, virtual land and works of art. While NFT’s are obviously intangible, NFT’s can also be used to digitally verify ownership of tangible goods. The code contained within each NFT makes them distinct, easily verifiable and digitally scarce. The NFT market is mostly built on the Ethereum blockchain with the main competitor being the NFT focused blockchain called Flow.</p>
<p class="">Non fungible tokens have mainstream appeal due to their usability, beauty and familiarity. NFT’s feel familiar because most of us have opened up a pack of sporting cards, made an in game purchase (or seen kids make them) or appreciated an amazing work of art. NFT’s bring these experiences into our digitally native society by making them verifiably scarce, unique and owned by you.</p>
<p class="">We can see this mainstream appeal in action when we look at NBA Top Shots, a digital version of collectible trading cards where each card is a video of a specific moment in a game. An <a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/listings/p2p/c561f66b-5bd8-451c-8686-156073c3fb69+d012e87f-7aec-4f5d-969b-2af03890ab4f">impressive block by rookie phenom Zion Williamson</a> of the New Orleans Pelicans will set you back US$210,000 if you want to buy it today. While <a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/listings/p2p/a494c64e-9e93-418c-8934-f331ee47a39b+768166e3-f4bb-4395-9b48-4c545aebc95c">this two handed dunk by LeBron James</a> was last sold for US$125,000 on the 25th February, although one lucky punter bought it for $1,999 on Christmas Eve. When it comes to digital art, Beeple is the artist making the most noise. <a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/100010001">This NFT of a Donald Trump looking character </a>recently sold for US$6.6 million on the secondary market after originally selling for $66,666.6 on November 1st.</p>
<p class="">While it can be argued that NFT’s offer attractive investment opportunities when it comes to art and unique items. It is both speculative and hard to define where the value will be captured when it comes to specific artists, games and items. However, we are keeping a close eye on infrastructure opportunities in the NFT marketplace should they become attractive in our eyes.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Decentralised Finance</strong><br />
Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is our final pillar of blockchain value. DeFi has been one of the driving forces of the bull market we are in today.</p>
<p class="">Decentralised finance represents the first time in human history that we have permissionless innovation in finance on a global scale. By using smart contracts and blockchain technology, developers are creating a more efficient, fair and trustless financial system that is gaining traction at an incredible rate. According to <a href="https://defipulse.com/">defipulse.com</a>, one year ago the total value locked (TVL) in decentralised finance protocols was only US$1 Billion, today TVL sits at US$38.4 billion.</p>
<p class="">We see this rapid increase in total value locked as a paradigm shift rather than a speculative bubble. Smart contracts enable the creation of genuine economic value, the liquidity locked in these smart contracts are providing a service and thus earn a yield. Of course, not all of DeFi is sustainable economic value creation and many projects will not last, but there are many crypto assets that have the potential to become widely acknowledged as high quality crypto assets.</p>
<p class="">Recently, The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis released a research report on <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2021/02/05/decentralized-finance-on-blockchain-and-smart-contract-based-financial-markets">“Decentralized Finance: On Blockchain- and Smart Contract Based Financial Markets”</a>. The article is aimed at providing policymakers, researchers and financial institutions with an introduction to the topic of DeFi. We view this level of research from key entities in the traditional financial system as extremely promising to the longer term value creation of DeFi.</p>

<p class="">Figure 2 in this research report outlines the ‘DeFi stack’, at Apollo Capital we aim to capture value across this DeFi stack. On the settlement layer we invest in Ethereum and have smaller positions in competing smart contract platforms that have potential. We invest in many fungible tokens (ERC-20) that we think have real value within their respective ecosystems. Our main focus of investment is at the protocol layer, this is where we see the most value being created.</p>
<p class="">Our focus on the application layer is smaller as we view the crypto assets at this layer as being of a lower quality. For example, a common token model at this level is to have a governance token (that isn’t used for any governance at the time) plus liquidity mining with rewards being paid out in that governance token, therefore rapidly reducing the value of the token through inflation.</p>
<p class="">The aggregator layer is similar to the application layer in the way that it is hard to find token models that are of a high quality. However, aggregator protocols such as <a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2020/12/1/investment-highlight-yearn-finance">Yearn Finance</a> and APY Finance are innovative and lead to positive user experiences and great overall returns.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true">
<p class="">Our views on the crypto markets are constantly changing in order to stay ahead of this incredibly fast moving space. As blockchain technology progresses into unexplored territories and industries, the current three pillars of blockchain value may one day become four or five.</p>

<p class="">The network launched on January 3, 2009. At the time, it was just a very small group of cryptographers that knew about Bitcoin.</p>
<p class="">Nine months later in November 2009, Bitcoin reached outside mailing lists and private emails as Satoshi created the Bitcointalk.org forum . The BitcoinTalk forum became the go-to place for discussion in relation to Bitcoin and also crypto in general and it remains popular to this day.</p>
<p class="">Bitcoin still wasn’t worth much if anything. In fact, it wasn’t until May 2010 that the first real-world transaction took place. The value of Bitcoin was then less than $0.01.</p>
<p class="">In July 2010 Bitcoin was introduced to a wider audience with an article in Slashdot. The site at that time was billing itself as ‘News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters’ — a large but limited audience. Slashdot has a big following among computer scientists and thus Bitcoin got in the public limelight for the first time. The price skyrocketed 900% to $0.08 over five days. In would go much higher, in February 2011 a Slashdot article mentioned that Bitcoin achieved ‘dollar parity’ or $1.00 — a milestone in the two year old currency. But the price rally wasn’t over. Forbes and Gawker published articles and the price of Bitcoin increased by another 30x over the coming 4 months.</p>
<p class="">In November 2011 Bitcoin would break out to an even bigger audience as this time Wired magazine was writing an article about the ‘Rise and Fall of Bitcoin’.</p>

<p class="">Bitcoin collapsed in value by 93% from a peak of over $29 in June 2011 to a low of $2.00 in December the same year.</p>
<p class="">At the time, no one could know for certain if Satoshi Nakamoto had unleashed an unstoppable force or if Bitcoin would slowly lose even more value and never come back.</p>
<p class="">It turned out that Slashdot, Forbes, Gawker and Wired had taken Bitcoin out from the small circle of cryptographers and computer scientist into the consciousness of a much larger audience and created an unstoppable force.</p>
<p class="">Bitcoin didn’t receive much media coverage in 2012 but the price started moving up again and as price appreciated it was going to break out to a much larger audience once again.</p>
<p class="">In March of 2013 Bitcoin hit $100 for the first time. The widely followed financial news cable network CNBC started regularly featuring Bitcoin.</p>

<p class="">Suddenly Bitcoin was breaking out to an audience in the hundreds of thousands. Bitcoin started increasing in price rapidly and in January 2014 reached $1,000 — another milestone.</p>
<p class="">While the online conversation was still happening on the BitcoinTalk forum that Satoshi started, the Bitcoin subreddit on Reddit had become one of the most popular places for online discussion. In the following years a large part of that conversation was moving to Twitter — what is now known as ‘Crypto Twitter’.</p>
<p class="">With the launch of Ethereum in 2015 and altcoins came a new wave of activity to the market. In 2017 the market was ready for another rally. The ICO boom slowly grew from early 2017 and by mid year it really picked up speed. The coming 6 months would see record activity media coverage and all time high prices. The crypto market had attracted attention of millions of people. Crypto had in many ways truly broken out into the mainstream.</p>
<p class="">With price, media interest slowed down in 2018. However big institutions had their eyes on the market and in 2019 Fidelity and ICE (NYSE) both announced the launch of their crypto related offerings. What really got crypto back in the spotlight however was the announcement by Facebook that they together with partners are launching a crypto currency called the Libra Coin.</p>
<p class="">Crypto was once again breaking out to a bigger audience and for the first time we had the President of the United States commenting on Bitcoin (and Libra), we had the Federal Reserve Chairman being asked about crypto in a congressional hearing and we had the treasury secretary holding a press conference about cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p class="">Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell in July 2019.</p>
<p class="">In the last month crypto has broken into the consciousness of the President of the United States and the lawmakers around the world. Federal Reserve Chairman called Bitcoin a speculative store of value, a digital gold and some lawmakers have come out as defenders of the unstoppable force that Bitcoin and crypto represent.</p>
<p class=""><span style="color: #333333; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Crypto is a reflection of a common belief, a network effect that grows stronger the more people joins the network. In its short 10 year history it has managed to make waves that have been felt in all corners of society around the world and no time previously has the waves been as big as in the last month. No doubt, the next leg up will bring in even more people and give even more attention to crypto.</span></p>

<p class="">Convexity is an interesting concept that explains why investors should pay attention to crypto as an asset class.</p>
<p class="">I believe there are actually two ways that crypto has convexity. The first one is more technical and the second one more broadly related to individual crypto assets and portfolio allocation:</p>
<ol data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class=""><strong>Crypto has deeply rooted technical convexity </strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="">As a former options trader, I learned that convexity is the concept of positive gamma. Gamma is the rate of change of the price sensitivity to the underlying price. If you’re ‘long gamma’ you will become more sensitive to price changes as the price goes up. Long gamma is a nice situation to be in, as the price goes up you will make more and more money (Short gamma on the other hand should be avoided like the plague.)</p>

<p class="">Why is crypto be ‘long gamma’? On a high level, base layer protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum are creating an immutable ledger where value and contracts can be exchanged between any two parties. That network only has value if the security is strong enough, i.e. the network is only trustless if we don’t have to worry about a rollback of previous transactions.</p>
<p class="">Since Bitcoin and Ethereum’s miners are paid in bitcoin and ether, the trustlessness of these crypto networks is a direct function of the price of those assets. Put another way, the value of the network as a secure ledger goes up as the price increases. This reflexivity means that 1. the network effect in crypto networks is strong 2. the immutability and thus the value proposition of the network increases with price — this self reinforcing effect is a form of positive gamma!</p>
<p class=""><strong>2. Crypto has convexity both in the micro and macro</strong></p>
<p class="">On the micro scale, there is a lot of experimentation and competition going on in crypto markets. If you have exposure to a diversified portfolio of crypto assets you are more likely to capture the returns from breakout crypto assets. This is the reason why we are building a portfolio aligned to our investment thesis that is diversified between different verticals and technologies . In option parlance we’re said to be ‘long volatility’. We can view the portfolio as a collection of call options.</p>
<p class="">Here it makes sense to mention another Greek letter, namely Theta. A call option has a negative theta, meaning that as time passes the value of the call option will decline as optionality decreases. If crypto assets are call options, I’d argue that the theta of a crypto asset is positive. This is due to the Lindy effect, which says the future life expectancy of a non-perishable thing like technology increases with time. Unlike call options that expire at a given time, crypto assets don’t expire. Instead, they prove themselves over time and become more trustworthy as time passes. If Lindy is valid for crypto assets, then they just have to survive to be successful — that’s a convex bet in time.</p>
<p class="">Secondly, on the macro side of things. By having 5% of crypto assets in your portfolio you are exposed to an asset class with limited downside (all of crypto is only US$150bn, a fraction of one company like Facebook) and with limitless upside. This has the added advantage that you can take much less risk with the rest of the portfolio. Instead of cultivating a portfolio of securities with average risk and average return expectations you can instead construct a portfolio where 90 or 95% of the portfolio has very little risk, maybe just enough to cover inflation while the rest of the portfolio has unlimited upside. Prof. in risk and philosopher Nassim N. Taleb describes this Barbell Strategy this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">“If you know that you are vulnerable to prediction errors, and accept that most risk measures are flawed, then your strategy is to be as hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive as you can be, instead of being mildly aggressive or conservative.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">We believe this very asymmetric return profile coupled with the uncorrelated nature of crypto assets makes this a very unusual and attractive asset class. On the contrary if you’re short, you have limited upside (100%) and unlimited downside.</p>
<p class="">The above reasons summarise why I like to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""><strong>‘Crypto is Convexity for your Portfolio’.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="">We often hear that crypto assets are not equity and therefore not valuable as an investment — i.e. they are great for the issuers as they don’t dilute shareholders. This is not necessarily the case.</p>
<p class="">Let’s have a look at Binance, whose CEO Changpeng Zhao in a recent interview said he believes their token Binance Coin might be more valuable than their equity. Simplifying somewhat, the company makes money by charging a commission on trades. The equity is a claim on the net profit, after all costs associated with running the exchange, all technology, marketing and personnel cost and so on. The company can choose to reinvest the profit or distribute that to its shareholders. The token, Binance Coin, gives you a discount on the trading fees on Binance. If the discount is 50%, all else equal, then half of all value should be captured in their token, less will flow down to shareholders. If the discount was 100% then no value would be captured by shareholders and everything would flow to token holders. The token holders thus capture value higher up the income statement.</p>

<p class="">The crypto landscape has seen the emergence of a new a kind of organisation not driven by shareholders but by a team working on a common project where the economics are centred around a crypto asset. Take MakerDAO as an example. MakerDAO is a decentralised lending facility on top of Ethereum. There is a not-for-profit foundation behind MakerDAO that can sell Maker tokens (currently in the top 20 of crypto assets) to finance the development of the MakerDAO system. The Maker token derives value from users borrowing money through ether collateralised loans — interest payments is made in the Maker token. Thus the Maker token is another example of a top income statement claim. There are no cost items that the Maker holders have to pay before realising value. That’s not a coincidence. The economics of crypto projects are driven by:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Open source. These projects need to be open source, otherwise they wouldn’t be ‘trustless’. If they were not trustless, they wouldn’t need to be built on a blockchain to start with. Unnecessary rent seeking in the open source protocol, will lead to a fork — someone will fork out the excess protocol level taxation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">All value captured in the token. Since any other value-capture can be forked out, there is no value left for profit seeking shareholders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="">In the brave new world of crypto, we see that shareholders are replaced by token holders. Employees are replaced by volunteers, grants or paid-in-token by the protocol contractors. The token becomes a measurement of success, the employees of Binance want to get paid by Binance Coin. The founder of MakerDAO lives and dies by the success of Maker, the token.</p>
<p class="">In the next bull market, we believe Bitcoin will surpass the market cap of the largest company in the world. I.e. crypto networks can be bigger than a single company and crypto assets can be more valuable than equity. It is definitely not the case for all crypto assets, only the most well built crypto networks adhere to the success formula described here. It’s our job at Apollo Capital to find these diamonds in rough.</p>

They are the fuel for running open, permissionless blockchains. The ICO hype created an environment where raising money became too easy. The result was that too many projects are trying to fit a token into a service or product where none is needed.</p>
<p>Blockchains are only valuable if they are decentralised. There are three major tenants of this technology and the applications running on top of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating censorship resistant applications: This can take many forms such as money, financial markets, gambling, prediction markets or social networks to name a few.</li>
<li>Creating permissionless applications: That is, an application that anyone can join. With Bitcoin you can be your own bank, or payment processor, without needing permission from a bank or credit card company.</li>
<li>Trustless applications: If we use a derivatives or a lending market, we don’t want to rely on the goodwill of a third party. With open source protocols anyone can inspect the code and the integrity of the application and engage in commerce with 0% counter-party risk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t pitch something that’s an easy pass</p>
<p>Many projects are creating a token where Bitcoin or Ether could be used, or maybe one of the many stablecoins. This is especially true if you’re creating a simple payment for service.</p>
<p>We think these ICOs should be funded by equity. At Apollo Capital, we see a future with millions of decentralised applications — and these will primarily be funded by equity. <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcompound.finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compound</a>, is an excellent example of a decentralised application built on top of smart contracts running on Ethereum. Compound is funded by equity, they are not creating a specific token where none is needed. This is how Apollo Capital forsees value accruing in the Web 3.0 era:</p>

<p>On one end there will be 1,000,000s of applications mostly funded by equity. On the other end there will be 10s of core blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dfinity et al. that run on, and in some cases are funded by, crypto assets. In between, we will have 1,000s of middleware crypto assets such as stablecoins, oracles, and file storage. Smart contracts built on top of blockchains will interact with these middleware building blocks. As an example, a smart contract interacting with a stablecoin and an oracle can provide the basics for an application providing trustless and permissionless lending and borrowing in this new decentralised world we call Web 3.0.</p>
<p>To sum it up — it is likely your ICO doesn’t need a token and if it doesn’t, it will become increasingly hard for you to get institutional funding for your project.</p>
<p>However, if your application is part of what is either a new core protocol or middleware project there might be a need for new a crypto asset. If you have unique technology and an ability to create the necessary network effect — come and speak with us!</p>

<p>There two big, emerging areas of value creation in the crypto space. These are centred around what we call <strong>‘Money-ness’</strong>and <strong>‘Governance’</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Money-ness</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>We added the suffix ‘- ness’ after money to emphasise the breadth of this category. Money-ness encompass everything from a global store of value to a currency specific to a crypto-economy or use-case.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The categorisation of crypto assets is oftentimes not clearcut (actually, almost never clearcut!). Take Bitcoin as an example. It’s deflationary and limited in supply, global, and not issued by a central authority. These qualities make it look very similar to gold. On the other hand, however, bitcoin derives value from being used as a currency to pay for goods and services. This is because it is easy and cheap to transfer globally and highly divisible. Settlement in Bitcoin has occurred globally on average every 10 minutes for almost a decade; Bitcoin’s smallest unit, a Satoshi, is one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin or 0.00000001 BTC. In this sense, it acts as <strong>both </strong>a digital gold equivalent and as an M1 (or cash) equivalent. With the introduction of the Lightening Network, the dual-character of bitcoin becomes even more pronounced.</p>
<p>On the other end of the money-ness spectrum you have pure utility tokens. Utility tokens are used to pay for a good or service in a particular crypto-economy, much like a laundry token is used in the physical world.</p>
<p>The category of money-ness is thus very broad but the defining question should always be<em><strong> </strong>&#8220;can this token act like money?&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Not all tokens in this the money-ness category are created equally for value accrual purposes. <strong>In our opinion, </strong><strong>in the long run store of value forms of money-ness will </strong><strong>accrue value while utility tokens won&#8217;t. </strong>This is because of the relative velocity, or turn over, of these forms of money-ness.</p>
<p>An example of a utility token is Binance Coin (BNB). BNB is used to pay transaction fees on the Binance crypto exchange. The major issue with the explosion of utility tokens is that if every good or service had its own token, we would all be driven mad trying to keep up with such a variety of currencies. No one would want to hold onto hundreds of utility coins that pay for hundreds of separate goods or services. The implication from all this is that the velocity for many if these coins is likely to be very high, and therefore the value of utility tokens will be low.</p>
<p>Why? Because rather than holding 100s of currencies, <strong>we are much more likely to hold just </strong><strong>one store of value</strong><strong>, then seamlessly swap in and out of utility tokens as we need them. </strong>Most people will not even realise that they are using distinct utility tokens as this process will be automated. In this version of the future, the velocity of utility tokens would be very high as people are not incentivised to hold the tokens for any length of time. Currently people are holding onto utility tokens for speculative reasons, but that incentive will recede when tokens begin to be used for their stated purpose. People won&#8217;t need to hold onto (or &#8216;HODL&#8217; in crypto-speak) utility tokens but will instead buy and sell them on-demand. This increases in the velocity of the token, and according to the <strong>value exchange equation, </strong>the network value <strong>tends towards zero </strong>with increased velocity:</p>
<p><strong>MV=PQ</strong></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<blockquote><p>M = Money Supply</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>V = Velocity of Money Supply (i.e. the amount of times the money supplies turns over)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>P = Price Level</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Q = Index of new real expenditures</p></blockquote>
<p>Because of this velocity problem, teams behind ICOs, developers and investors have attempted to artificially lower velocity as they all have an interest in increased network value over time. This have lead to discussions over clever ways to create ‘velocity sinks’ in order to increase the token value. However, we perceive this as not a viable way to create value.</p>

<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p>A common example of where a utility token may be needed is for a decentralised markets in the sharing economy. Mike Novogratz, founder of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital Management, likes to highlight the example of a decentralised model for ride-sharing. It&#8217;s also a good example of why utility tokens won&#8217;t accrue value.</p>
<p>Uber is the highest valued private tech company in the world with a market capitalisation of $69.9bn. In a Decentralised-Uber (dUber) equivalent little value would likely accrue in the dUber token itself. We can think of that difference in value between Uber and dUber being mainly due to the radical reduction in the 25%+ cut that Uber captures in fees. This fee would by definition be almost eliminated in a dUber world. As a user, the application layer would automatically trade bitcoin, for example, into dUber tokens in real time so the user never actually holds onto it for a substantial period. You may not even realise there was a token in the middle, and potentially only see you BTC balance change following the ride.</p>
<p>Lastly, utility tokens may not accrue value due a lack of network effects because of, funnily enough, utility. Existent crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum can often be used in place of a utility token like the Binance Coin. A concerning number of the projects that come across our desk at Apollo Capital do not need their own native token, and simply staple one of for fundraising purposes.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure utility tokens might not capture much value at all, because the velocity will likely be high.</li>
<li>Many projects might not need their own token. The value of an artificial token used for fundraising is <strong>highly</strong> questionable.</li>
<li>On the investment side, we see value accruing in the store of value that incentivise HODLing, rather than in utility tokens that incentivise high velocity trading.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, many tokens are not pure cut, and crypto-assets used to fuel smart contract platforms like Ethereum’s ETH can be in part store of value, in part currency, and in part utility for paying gas on the Ethereum platform. There are clearly different degrees of ‘Money-ness’, but these principles should help in deciphering which token will likely have long term value, and which will not.</p>

<p>The other big value creator in crypto is governance. We’re in a phase where projects experiment with how governance is distributed and architectured within crypto networks.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s governance is distributed between different stakeholders like miners, developers, users, wallets, and exchanges. In Decred, the coin holders have a much larger say in how the network is developed through their hybrid proof-of work/stake system. Other systems like Tezos are inventing new forms of on-chain governance. The 0x project was thought of as a utility token, but is turning into more of a pure governance token. The relayers in the 0x eco-system do not actually need to use the 0x token for payments, and are using it rather to vote on governance. The team behind 0x realises that as velocity goes to infinity, the payment aspect of 0x is not actually where the value lies.</p>
<p><strong>Governance in itself is valuable. </strong>If you want to control the future of the protocol you’re investing in or building an app on top of, the governance is very valuable. Do you think Apple considers it&#8217;s ability to determine what apps can and cannot go on their App Store as valuable? Of course they do. And the app developers would also find it valuable if there was a way for them to contribute to the App Stores governance. At the moment, app developers on iOS have no say on the governance of the Apple app store. <strong>Open crypto networks enable community-led governance, or, in classic crypto jargon, <em>decentralised governance. </em> </strong></p>
<p>Crypto assets represent new methods to organise society based on merit and free markets. Governance is a critical factor in these networks. <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/crypto-commons-da602fb98138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This</a> is an excellent article about network governance by Mike Maple, Jr.</p>
<p>How these values are captured are critical issues to think about for developers as well as for investors in this space.</p>
<p>In our emerging decentralised world of crypto assets, Money-ness and Governance are two of the leading value creators. This is where Apollo focuses investment.</p>

<p>A common question we receive at Apollo is what return can investors expect from investing in the Fund. It is an impossible question to answer. Yet, while the disclaimer “Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance” is suitable, it is interesting to examine past returns from crypto funds. Such analysis doesn’t necessarily answer the previous question, but it does offer insight into the range of possible returns and volatility for which investors should be prepared.</p>
<p>At Apollo Capital, we undertook this research by examining the returns of the average crypto hedge fund, made available by <a href="http://www.eurekahedge.com/">Eurekahedge</a>. Eurekahedge maintains a database of over 30,000 hedge funds, including crypto hedge funds. The Eurekahedge index provided 58 monthly data points from June 2013 to April 2018. The data relates to the average performance of crypto funds monitored by Eurekahedge. For ease of reference, we can consider this data to represent the average crypto fund return.</p>
<p>From analysing the data, we can extract results like Average Returns and the Largest Monthly Return. A deeper dive reveals even more insightful information like the Average Return in Up Months and Average Return in Down Months.</p>
<p>The Return for the period was 21,710%, which equates to a compound annual return of 304%.</p>
<p>The Mean Monthly Return from June 2013 to April 2018 was 16.1%. The Median Monthly Return was 7.6%. The difference between the Mean and Median return can be explained by a few bumper months which dragged the Mean return up.</p>
<p>The Largest Monthly Return was 405.3%, recorded in November 2013.</p>
<p>The Largest Monthly Drawdown was -29.9% in March 2018.</p>
<p>There were 36 Up Months compared to 22 Down Months.</p>
<p>The Average Return in Up Months was 33.9% and the Average Return in Down Months was -12.9%.</p>
<p>The lowest return in an Up Month was 2.0% and the highest return in a Down Month was -1.4%.</p>

<p>We can see that most returns fell within the range of -20% to +30%. It is easy to observe this without stopping to reflect. A -15% return in a given month has not been uncommon.</p>
<p>On the positive side, we can see that large returns have been frequent. There were a total of 5 months that returned greater than 50% for the month. Returns of +30%, +40% and greater have not been uncommon.</p>
<p>Returns that are common in crypto would be classed as extreme in nearly every other asset class. We could imagine the mayhem that would follow a monthly return of -15% in global equities. The same return in crypto is just another month. We believe the reason for this is clear &#8211; crypto is a young asset class and will likely continue to be volatile as it matures. We believe volatility will settle as institutional money enters the space.</p>
<p>For us, the most important lesson is that crypto investors need to be prepared. Returns that can otherwise be classed as extreme are not uncommon in crypto and most importantly, should not come as a surprise to investors.</p>
<p>The Apollo Capital Fund has been set up with a philosophy of long term investing. We believe that in crypto, and arguably other asset classes, the largest returns are had over the long term. To some extent, we are indifferent to the monthly volatility. We believe patient investors with an understanding of the investment thesis and an understanding of the expected volatility of returns will be rewarded.</p>

<p>Crypto-assets are new. Some are fungible, others digitally unique, they are tradable assets that depending on their underlying code and network economics, act sometimes like money, gold, consumables, collectables, or something completely different. Our current ability to effectively value these assets is sadly very limited. Even the most respected global hedge funds make basic mistakes in crypto valuation. Too many crypto investors blindly rely on the greater fool theory and the madness of crowds.</p>
<p>The crypto-market is retail driven. Institutional investors have so far stayed on the sidelines. The total crypto network value is currently around US$450bn down from a recent high of over US$830bn in January. Compared to almost any other asset class this is tiny. Global equities have a market capitalisation of over US$80 trillion; bonds, over US$23 trillion; derivatives, over US$1 quadrillion. That said, many protocols are clearly massively overvalued. Today there a multi-billion dollar coins that lacks a blockchain, a network, or anything resembling a product.</p>

<p>Is not really strange to have overvaluations coupled with massive potential upside. If we think of many projects like early start-ups — the big outsized returns will come from a few winners. Our job as fund managers are to managed a diversified portfolio where we are exposed to this convexity. A few winners will likely make up lion-share of returns.</p>
<p>With more investment pouring in, it’s increasingly important that we have frameworks to help us understand where best to put that money. Institutional investors have thus far kept their distance, but are now entering the space. Goldman Sachs recently confirmed their intention to trade in bitcoin, and ICE, the parent company to NYSE is allegedly launching a crypto platform. While there are still a number of practical hurdles to that process, such as a lack for qualified custodians for crypto assets and clarity on tax and regulation, another hurdle is a lack of trusted valuation techniques.</p>
<p>People like <a href="https://twitter.com/cburniske" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Burniske</a>, partner at Placeholder, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fundstrat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Lee</a> Co-founder of Fundstrat, have done important, early, work on the value of utility tokens and network effects in blockchains. Chris Burniske rightly states that by definition each crypto-asset functions as a currency in the protocol economy it supports. Here, the equation of exchange (MV=PQ) can be used to determine the flow of money needed to support that economy, where M is the size of the monetary base necessary to support a crypto-economy of size PQ, at velocity V. Thomas Lee has worked on another equation called Metcalfe’s law. Metcalfe’s Law says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users in that network. Based on this model, Fundstrat found that 94% of bitcoin’s price moves in the last four years can be explained. Unfortunately, however, the equation is more descriptive that predictive. Another technique being use is a ratio based valuation called Network Value to Transactions, or NVT. This has been dubbed the PE ratio for crypto. The main idea behind this is to relate the price of the crypto-asset to its fundamental use, in this case the daily volume of on-chain transactions. Despite these techniques, some crypto-assets don’t fit neatly into any of these frameworks. As an example, investors are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a form of digital commodity, or gold 2.0. In this case, valuation can be determined by looking at bitcoin as a substitute to the gold market and simply deriving how much one bitcoin would be worth if it took, say, 5% of the today’s gold market.</p>
<p>In general, we still need much more research around the value of these new networks. Companies like <a href="http://messari.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Messari</a> are doing this by building a research database, but more needs to be done an even experts are making serious blunders in their valuations.</p>
<p><a href="https://multicoin.capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multicoin Capital</a> is a $50m hedge fund based in the US which has raised money from the likes of Marc Andreessen. They have publicly accessible research and valuation reports available on their website — a really fantastic resource. Last week I had a look at their model for 0x. Apollo Capital happens to like the 0x project (we are not currently holders of the 0x token), and this partly is due to the difficulty in valuing its native token. Multicoin produced a model attempting to do just this but due to a simple mistake their valuation overvalued 0x by a factor 2–4x. This was the conversation that followed on Twitter with the co-founder of Multicoin, <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleSamani?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Samani</a>:</p>

<p>Crypto is an area where even professional investors make simple errors which go undetected for a long time. This just doesn’t happen in more traditional markets.

<p>They link back to another post by Multicoin explaining the effect of velocity, arguing that 0x will ultimately have <em>zero value</em> (more on that in a future post) as a utility token. All the value in 0x might instead come from it being a governance token. I think it is fair to say we just don’t know yet how to accurately value governance in blockchain networks, and that people don’t understand the effect velocity will have on the value of their utility tokens.</p>
<p>Binance Coin is another interesting example of the state of crypto valuation. Binance was a hugely successful ICO: after only 8 months they reported a <a href="https://www.ccn.com/binance-surpassed-germanys-biggest-bank-deutsche-in-profitability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher profit in Q1 than 148 year old Deutsche Bank</a>. The use of the Binance Coin is outlined in their <a href="https://www.binance.com/resources/ico/Binance_WhitePaper_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white paper</a>. In the first 4 years, Binance Coins gives users a discount on fees on their trading platform. After 4 years the only use of the Binance Coins will be on their yet to be built decentralised exchange.</p>
<p>So how do we value Binance Coin? It’s firstly important to remember that Binance is using a share of their Q1 profit to buy back up to 100M of the total 200M coins in circulation. We can now calculate the utility value for BNB the first 4 years and we can assume a circulating supply adjusted for the buyback. The problem is that, it is very hard to come up good assumptions after year 4 as there are just too many unknowns at this point. How do we not value Binance Coin? <a href="https://medium.com/bambouclub/a-valuation-calculator-for-binance-coin-af3e18a579fc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/BambouClub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@BambouClub</a> is a good example. The writer applies a PE-ratio of 51 to the buyback. This of course makes no sense at all since we know there will ultimately be at least 100M coins in circulation, so we can just adjust the utility value with a lower coin count. Someone who <em>did</em>like this ‘analysis’ is the young billionaire CEO of Binance, Zhao Changing, who invited BambouClub to dinner:</p>
