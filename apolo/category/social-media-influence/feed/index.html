										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What struck me when watching the first game of the first round of the AFL season a few weeks back, which incidentally was the 2021 Grand Final rematch between the Western Bulldogs and the Melbourne Demons, was the overt ‘crypto’ presence that was on my TV screen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watching that Grand Final rematch rarely was there a moment during the telecast that crypto didn’t have a visual presence. The jumper sponsor for the Western Bulldogs, CoinSpot – an Australian based Cryptocurrency exchange, was prominent. Crypto.com, a major sponsor of the AFL, could be seen via fence advertising around the stadium and even on billboards on punt road! That major sponsorship deal over five years placed Crypto.com as the Official Cryptocurrency Trading Platform of the AFL and AFLW, worth a reported $25 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Crypto.com is a Singapore based cryptocurrency exchange.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further embedding Crypto into the AFL landscape, AFL CEO Gillan McLachlan revealed the AFL has partnered with Animoca Brands to release NFT’s, non-fungible tokens, in a unique deal that will share revenue with the AFL Players Association. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animoca Brands was once listed on the ASX, now based in Hong Kong, is one of the world&#8217;s leading blockchain gaming NFT studios, worth more than US$5 billion. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During my 12-year professional AFL sporting career with the Hawthorn Hawks, we had many and varied corporate partners. An internet provider, health care provider, car brand and even a State Government just to name a few &#8211; not to mention the obligatory footwear / apparel sponsor. All brands were and still are prevalent corporations within their respective industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin, least of all Crypto Assets, to most during my career, were nothing more than a meme, or perceived fad. Now the services that allow you to buy and trade these assets sit amongst the major sponsors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this new financial world encroaches further into traditional finance, ironically NAB, one of the AFL’s longest standing sponsors, was also advertising around the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discussion around Cryptocurrency has intensified and can no longer be dismissed. The stability and long-term success of crypto assets is some way from being determined, yet the adoption of crypto assets by traditional financial institutions and even nation states, must be acknowledged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonwealth Bank Australia announced in November last year, ‘that it will become Australia’s first bank to offer customers the ability to buy, sell and hold crypto assets, directly through the CommBank app.’</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a few weeks ago, reported in the Australian Financial Review, ANZ ‘has minted a digital asset linked to the value of the Australian dollar,’ otherwise known as a stable coin. Adoption by these financial institutions suggests others will soon follow suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, Crypto.com is making a huge splash to lift their profile. Most notably, via a reported $700 million deal to rename the Staples Centre, home of LeBron James’ LA Lakers, Crypto.com Arena.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto.com has sponsored teams and leagues within soccer, hockey, and mixed martial arts, among a slew of sponsorship deals within the sporting landscape, Further, the platform has also committed to a campaign with Matt Damon – for a reported $100 million. All in an attempt to attract the eyeballs of an ever-growing, affluent youth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s not just Crypto.com ramping up their marketing budget in an attempt to onboard new users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance, the world’s largest Crypto exchange by trading volume, caught the global music industry’s attention when they recently signed a partnership agreement for the 64th GRAMMY Awards. Only a few days prior to that announcement, Binance purchased a $200 million stake in Forbes magazine, also taking  two of the nine seats on their board of directors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Binance.US, the United States partner company, secured $200 million in seed financing at a $4.5 billion pre-money valuation.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst we have mentioned both crypto.com and Binance, when it comes to sponsorship expenditure, FTX must take pole position. FTX, the fastest growing crypto currency exchange over the past three years, now valued at $32 billion, have now partnered with NFL legend Tom Brady and his supermodel wife, Gisele Bundchen. According to the company&#8217;s press release, the couple will work as ambassadors for equity in the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX has also inked deals with the Miami Heat, Major League Baseball and the Mercedes Formula One team, as we saw recently watching the Melbourne Grand Prix. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might ask why these sponsorship examples I have noted are all crypto exchanges? The 2 most significant reasons are that these exchanges are the bridge for the masses to gain crypto exposure. And in doing so, naturally the exchanges take a small clip of those transactions. Furthermore, these are centralised exchanges. Profits are held by the company to then redistribute, in part, to further sponsorship. The examples cited above gives you some indication of the amount of money flowing through these exchanges. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These large sporting brands and identities partnering with Crypto businesses, must first gain an understanding and level of trust in regards to the crypto landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A landscape that is developing quickly, both through a wealth creation, and adoption lens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently when I contacted Western Bulldogs CEO Ameet Bains, he admitted there was some initial trepidation given his lack of understanding of the Crypto industry. He was promptly reassured by his directors and advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial CoinSpot sponsorship deal was extended beyond the 1 year term to now represent 3 years and to further include their AFLW team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, Ameet is most excited about the advancements of blockchain and the opportunity to engage with the Western Bulldogs community via NFT’s and membership deals.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This merger between the new financial world and the old shall catch many off guard. More so, it’s the rate of change that shall surprise most. Given the AFL industry accepted Crypto centric sponsorship dollars for the first time last year, I wonder to what extent does the AFL understand this has the ability to cannibalise and create conflict with one of their longest standing partners, NAB. Perhaps this notion of the inevitability of crypto asset adoption has already been considered. Those who embrace the new asset class, such as the AFL, will have a head start on those who are hesitant. Only time will tell.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Blockchain Australia event a few weeks back, NAB executive, innovation and partnerships Howard Silby, said “banks are starting to have a mainstream blockchain moment”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These comments were made off the back of it being noted that NAB, alongside UBS, Standard Chartered &amp; BNP Paribas among others, has begun developing its own stablecoin to help settle trades on its carbon credit platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given NABs’ sponsorship of the AFL, and the possible collision course of the emerging and traditional financial systems, does that jeopardise the sponsorship money the AFL is set to receive?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, does this merely signal what is happening more broadly within society? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 years ago, crypto to the majority, was a meme. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the largest sporting brands and the highest profiled individuals around the world, are comfortable to partner with Crypto exchanges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this rate of change and adoption, where will crypto sit within our mindset in another 4 years time?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Crypto Glossary Terms</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like in traditional finance, there is no shortage of crypto jargon that can make the average crypto newbie feel confused. Today we wanted to help define a few of these crypto native terms to educate readers. Unlike in the movie “The Big Short”, we were unfortunately unable to obtain A-list celebrities to explain these terms in exotic places.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Crypto Finance Terms</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMM &#8211; Automated Market Maker</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMM’s allow digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way by using liquidity pools rather than a &#8216;traditional market of &#8220;asks and bids&#8221;. AMM users supply liquidity pools with crypto assets. Other users can then enter those liquidity pools and swap one asset for another.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridging</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving crypto assets from one blockchain to another. This process usually involves locking the crypto asset on the original chain and then minting the equivalent on the destination chain. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CeFi</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centralised Finance &#8211; Refers to crypto finance that relies on third party intermediaries to function e.g. centralised exchanges and centralised lending platforms like BlockFi &amp; Nexo</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeFi </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralised Finance &#8211; Refers to a subset of crypto projects that aim to build financial applications on top of blockchains using smart contracts </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDP &#8211; Collateralised Debt Position</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CDP is created when an asset is borrowed (on Aave/ Compound) or minted (DAI, MIM) against funds locked in a smart contract. The value of the locked funds must be greater than the debt position.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flippening</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term ‘Flippening’ is given to a crypto asset that surpasses another crypto asset in market capitalisation terms. ‘Flippening’ is most commonly used to anticipate Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin in market capitalisation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas is the common term given to the amount of a native token used on smart contract platforms to buy and sell goods and services. Gas costs can be variable depending on the demand for the smart contract platform. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICO / IDO / IEO</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Initial DEX Offering (IDO) and Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) are names given to public fundraising rounds. They are the final round of raising a project team will perform before releasing their token to the market. ICOs are typically conducted privately with whitelisting of investors, whereas an IEO takes place on a centralised exchange and an IDO, on a permissionless decentralised exchange (DEX).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impermanent Loss (IL)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impermanent loss can occur when providing liquidity to an Automated Market Maker (AMM) due to the constant product function that liquidity pools utilise. As prices fluctuate, the total balance of each asset in the pool also changes, resulting in liquidity providers owning a different balance of coins compared to what they initially deposited. Impermanent loss is when this change in balance results in less returns than what could be achieved if the users just held the assets. It is “impermanent” because IL is mitigated if prices return back to what they were when the assets were deposited. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liquidity Pool</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Liquidity pool can be thought of as a pot of cryptocurrency assets locked within a smart contract, which can be used for exchanges, loans and other applications.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crypto-native derivative contract pioneered by crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX. This contract uses an intra-day funding rate to push the derivative price towards the spot price. Long and short traders either pay the funding rate or get paid the funding rate depending on the difference between the spot price and the derivative’s price.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play-to-Earn (P2E)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play-to-Earn (P2E) refers to the concept of gaming in which a platform provides its players the chance to earn any form of in-game assets that can be transferred to crypto assets or liquidated into fiat as a tangible asset. Play-to-Earn was made most famous by the well-known blockchain game &#8216;Axie Infinity&#8217;. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slippage </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between the current/expected price of a trade and the executed price of a trade. Slippage can be a significant problem for AMM liquidity pools pool with low liquidity. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Funding Trade</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding trade is a derivatives strategy to take advantage of the Perpetual Future&#8217;s funding rate. Usually, this strategy involves shorting the Perpetual Future while holding the equivalent amount in spot in order to collect the funding rate paid by long traders of the Perpetual Future. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TradFi </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional Finance &#8211; Refers to legacy financial infrastructure and institutions such as Banks.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitelisting</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitelisting is the act of reserving the right to participate in a crypto investments or minting of an NFT for particular crypto addresses. The owners of these addresses may be required to perform certain activities such as KYC, answer questionnaires and promote projects on social media to achieve the whitelisting. Similar to a ‘Cap Table’ in traditional finance, a list of whitelisted addresses will be the addresses guaranteed an investment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yield Farming</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yield farming involves locking capital into DeFi smart contracts in order to earn yield in the form of fees/interest and governance tokens.

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Moon&#8217; is a native to crypto term that signifies significant price appreciation. As you would imagine, it is used commonly in crypto discourse when there is bullish sentiment. For example, &#8216;Ethereum is going to the moon!&#8217; Fun fact: Apollo Capital was named “Apollo” partly in fun because we aim to help take our investors to the moon!</span></li>

<p><b>Technical Terms</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fork </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fork occurs when the rules of a blockchain are changed, possibly creating two (or more) distinct digital assets. This may result from an upgrade to the features of the blockchain, a bug in the consensus algorithm, or changes to the node software. Check out our blog post </span><a href="https://www.apollocap.io/forking-explained/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Forking Explained&#8217;.</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-Sig or Multi-Signature</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-signature, or multi-sig, is a feature of bitcoin and other digital assets that requires multiple private keys to sign a transaction and move funds. Practically speaking, multi-sig can be used to add an extra layer of security to digital asset transactions by requiring additional approval from a third party before a transaction is approved. Digital asset custodians typically use multi-sig wallets and processes to help secure client funds.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Node</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nodes are software that run on internet-connected computers and function as non-mining transaction validators and digital asset wallets. In Bitcoin, for example, full nodes download the entire blockchain and validate each transaction per the agreed-upon rules of the network and relay transactions and blocks to others.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rollups</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rollups perform transaction execution outside layer one by “rolling up” or aggregating transactions, and then posting the data to layer one where consensus is reached. As transaction data is included in layer one blocks, rollups are secured by native base layer one security.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenomics</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenomics is the topic of understanding the supply and demand characteristics of crypto assets. Projects will have specific tokenomic designs to drive particular outcomes for their protocol. Circulating market capitalisation, fully diluted market capitalisation, airdrops, seed round fundraising, ICO/IDO and treasury are all items of consideration when designing a tokenomics model. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero-Knowledge Proof</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are an experimental technology that allow one to cryptographically prove a statement, without revealing the input data. For instance, one could prove that a transaction was included in the blockchain without telling you which transaction it is. This technology is currently being used in various layer two projects on Ethereum to enable Ethereum to scale appropriately in the future. </span></li>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1623053164602_706" class="">In September 2018, the Apollo Capital Fund made a seed investment into Dfinity, which was described as <a href="https://www.apollocap.io/blog/2018/9/4/apollo-capital-a16z-crypto-polychain-among-investors-indfinity">“the most exciting project of 2018”</a>. The foundation behind the Internet Computer (ICP), The Dfinity Foundation, has raised over US$200 million from top-tier crypto investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital. After two and a half years of gruelling development, the ambitious project has successfully launched with their Internet Computer (ICP) token listing on top exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Huobi.</p>
<p class="">Internet Computer currently trades at US$112 with a market capitalisation of US$14 billion, representing a 23x return for the Capital Fund, and ranking ICP as the 11th largest crypto asset <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/internet-computer">according to Coingecko</a>.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Founder &amp; Vision</strong></p>
<p class="">The Internet Computer is spearheaded by Dfinity’s highly capable Founder and Chief Scientist, Dominic Williams. Dominic has had a distinguished career as a crypto theoretician and serial entrepreneur focused on the Internet and distributed systems. His scientific discoveries across Threshold Relay chains, PSC chains and many other innovations have pioneered new approaches to cryptography and blockchain technology.</p>
<p class="">A key underpinning of Domenic’s success is his unmistakably bold vision for the project. “Our mission is to push towards a blockchain singularity, where the majority of the world’s systems and services are created using smart contracts, and run entirely on chain, a transformation that will take years”. While Domenic’s slightly audacious claims about the potential of the project have received some scepticism from the wider crypto community, the attention grabbing valuation of ICP demonstrates that there is no shortage of big VC’s that share the vision and believe in Domenic.</p>

<p class=""><strong>The Protocol </strong></p>
<p class="">The Internet Computer does not aim to directly compete with existing blockchains but instead break new ground by reinventing and decentralising the Web stack. If the project is successful, it will bring an abundance of viable new use cases to the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p class="">The problem Dfinity is addressing extends beyond just blockchain technology. It aims to build a decentralized, scalable cloud-like platform that can store data, perform computation, and support community-driven governance. Dfinity wants the internet itself to support software applications and data, rather than simply providing peer-to-peer connections and relying on proprietary cloud-hosting services to handle the rest.</p>
<p class="">The Internet Computer’s version of smart contracts (known as “canisters”) are very different to the smart contracts that existing blockchain communities are familiar with. Canisters run at web speed, can serve web experiences directly to end users providing end-to-end blockchain security, can be used to create scalable dapps, and can process and store data at relatively stable cost that is a tiny fraction of that on traditional blockchain.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Protocol Interoperability</strong></p>
<p class=""><a href="https://medium.com/dfinity/internet-computer-ethereum-integration-explained-6967456e35f9">In a recent blog post</a>, Dominic Williams explores the opportunities of direct interoperability between the Internet Computer and the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p class=""><em>“For example, you can imagine that a DeFi system running on Ethereum might use smart contracts on the Internet Computer to securely serve user experience to end users, rather than using an insecure website hosted on the Amazon Web Services cloud — which forces end-users to trust the website operator is honest, that AWS is honest, and that the account has not been hacked, such that they can never really be sure they are even interacting with smart contracts. This simple potential application of integration hints at the possibilities. The combination of the two networks will be incredibly powerful.” </em></p>
<p class="">The potential for the Internet Computer to compliment existing blockchains through interoperability is an exciting development in the blockchain ecosystem. These inter-protocol synergies will enable innovative new decentralised application (dapp) structures to emerge that boost immutability, decentralisation and security.</p>
<p class="">In March 2021, two well known DeFi protocols operating on the Binance Smart Chain suffered domain name service (DNS) attacks, causing their websites to become inaccessible for hours. This event highlighted that decentralised finance is still reliant on many centralised entities and solutions that are a potential point of failure.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1623053164602_711" class="">While we believe the current valuation of ICP is a relatively accurate representation of the protocol’s core value and potential, as a recently launched project it is also widely accepted that the Internet Computer has a long way to go until the underlying vision is achieved. We are excited to see how the Internet Computer develops over the coming years and believe that ICP compliments our layer 1 blockchain portfolio. Our successful investment into Dfinity in 2018 demonstrates the asymmetrical return potential of our &#8216;early stage investments&#8217; portfolio.</p>
