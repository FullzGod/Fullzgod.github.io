For example, ARKK fell 34% by May 2021 and by June 14, 2022, it had dropped 76% from its Feb 2021 high.\u00a0 Understandably, long duration equities are expected to deliver a higher proportion of future cash flows in the distant future and can be expected to suffer in a rising rate environment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More generally, as interest rates have increased since January 2022 (US 10-year yield from 1.68% to 3.48%) the SP 500 has fallen over -22.1% from all time highs, and US government bonds (TLT -20 year) have lost -24.3% YTD (both in US$).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crypto and digital assets, also considered a disruptive technology, have suffered in this environment.\u00a0 As of 20 June 2022, BTC\/USD has fallen 70.1% from its 2021 peak, and the Crypto10 index (Top 10 crypto assets by market cap) has fallen 81.5% from its November 2021 highs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many headlines promote the demise of innovative technology and crypto with their price falls, the long-term participants in small cap technology and crypto environments have experienced frequent falls of significant magnitude in the past.\u00a0 The table below highlights the volatility and price swing potential in BTC\/USD.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understandably, the volatility and risk of capital loss would dictate sizing within a portfolio to be relatively small. For example, a typical allocation may be .50% to 3.0% of a total portfolio, with crypto enthusiasts holding a higher level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Figure 1\u00a0 BTC\/USD Historical Worst Drawdowns<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1489\" src=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/BTC-Drawdowns-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1263\" height=\"982\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/BTC-Drawdowns-1.jpg 1263w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/BTC-Drawdowns-1-300x233.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/BTC-Drawdowns-1-1024x796.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/BTC-Drawdowns-1-768x597.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1263px) 100vw, 1263px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Asset Allocation and Re-Balancing<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our view, overall portfolio asset allocation should be constructed for all economic environments. This macro winter&#8217;s fall in bonds and equities highlights the flaws of 60\/40 portfolio allocation and an overreliance on historical correlation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, allocations for growth, recession, inflation, and deflationary periods (see Permanent Portfolio or Artemis\u2019s Dragon Portfolio) are more fundamentally diversified portfolios, enabling rebalancing when markets present opportunities. This includes selling winners and re-balancing regularly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In evaluating the impact of a 3% BTC-USD allocation to a 60\/40 portfolio from 2017 to the end of May 2022, investors would still be significantly ahead.\u00a0 Importantly, BTC has faced three significant \u2018crypto winters\u2019 in this 5-year period, falling over 50% on each occasion. (Dec 2017-Dec 2018 fell more than 83%)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following chart and table of performance include regular re-balancing (quarterly) of a portfolio comprised of 60% SP 500, 30% TLT (20-year US bonds) and 10% ST vanguard treasury compared with a portfolio of 60% SP 500, 30% TLT (20-year US bonds), 7% ST vanguard treasury, and 3% BTCUSD.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1494\" src=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1302\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image.png 1302w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-300x156.png 300w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-1024x531.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-768x398.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1302px) 100vw, 1302px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1495\" src=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1pictures-btc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1871\" height=\"803\" data-wp-editing=\"1\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1pictures-btc.jpg 1871w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1pictures-btc-300x129.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1pictures-btc-1024x439.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1pictures-btc-768x330.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1pictures-btc-1536x659.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1pictures-btc-1568x673.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1871px) 100vw, 1871px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As highlighted above, SP 500 and TLT (20 year) have weighed heavily in the performance attribution in this macro winter. While crypto assets have not provided diversification in this environment, they certainly are not the main culprits of capital destruction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Active portfolio management and the ability to take profit on the way up, rebalance, and conversely, in this environment, re-balance from cash and outperforming defensive assets into high quality risk assets at depressed pricing should continue to serve investors well.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Importantly, risk assets, including small cap innovative technology, have a role to play in prudent investment portfolios.\u00a0 While no one has 100% certainty on how long this macro winter will last or how far risk assets may fall, an environment for growth assets will return at some point in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our view, Bitcoin and Ethereum are credible innovative technologies that will exist and thrive as the adoption of blockchain, smart contracts and non-inflationary assets continue to grow.\u00a0 Other technology, including AAPL, AMZN, high-quality smaller cap technology companies and new digital assets, will go through a re-rating in this macro winter, and all survivors will build into the next cycle.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sizing of higher volatile assets in a portfolio, especially within the nascent digital asset class, should be represented in small allocations.\u00a0 However, as illustrated, small allocations can have a meaningful positive asymmetric impact on portfolio returns and improved risk adjusted returns &#8211; especially for investors that re-balance regularly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Disclaimer: <\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This material has been prepared as educational material and is not intended to be used as investment advice.\u00a0 Instead, this information should be used as background information only and does not purport to make any recommendation upon which you may reasonably rely without further and more specific advice.
