Our current ability to effectively value these assets is sadly very limited. Even the most respected global hedge funds make basic mistakes in crypto valuation. Too many crypto investors blindly rely on the greater fool theory and the madness of crowds.<\/p>\n<p>The crypto-market is retail driven. Institutional investors have so far stayed on the sidelines. The total crypto network value is currently around US$450bn down from a recent high of over US$830bn in January. Compared to almost any other asset class this is tiny. Global equities have a market capitalisation of over US$80 trillion; bonds, over US$23 trillion; derivatives, over US$1 quadrillion. That said, many protocols are clearly massively overvalued. Today there a multi-billion dollar coins that lacks a blockchain, a network, or anything resembling a product.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527135468627_42358\" class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-text-ready\" data-block-type=\"5\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626319937713_106\" class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626319937713_105\" class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n\n        \" data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"><\/p>\n<figure id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626319937713_104\" class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"><\/p>\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626319937713_103\" class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n\n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \" data-animation-role=\"image\" data-animation-override=\"\"><img class=\"thumb-image loaded\" src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1527136424227-IZY7V6RP4KD75BUR2QCS\/Ari+Paul+Tweet.png?format=750w\" alt=\"Ari Paul Tweet.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1527136424227-IZY7V6RP4KD75BUR2QCS\/Ari+Paul+Tweet.png\" data-image=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1527136424227-IZY7V6RP4KD75BUR2QCS\/Ari+Paul+Tweet.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"323x173\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5b0640a71ae6cfbad93605a4\" data-type=\"image\" data-image-resolution=\"750w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527135468627_45860\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p>Is not really strange to have overvaluations coupled with massive potential upside. If we think of many projects like early start-ups\u200a\u2014\u200athe big outsized returns will come from a few winners. Our job as fund managers are to managed a diversified portfolio where we are exposed to this convexity. A few winners will likely make up lion-share of returns.<\/p>\n<p>With more investment pouring in, it\u2019s increasingly important that we have frameworks to help us understand where best to put that money. Institutional investors have thus far kept their distance, but are now entering the space. Goldman Sachs recently confirmed their intention to trade in bitcoin, and ICE, the parent company to NYSE is allegedly launching a crypto platform. While there are still a number of practical hurdles to that process, such as a lack for qualified custodians for crypto assets and clarity on tax and regulation, another hurdle is a lack of trusted valuation techniques.<\/p>\n<p>People like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cburniske\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chris Burniske<\/a>, partner at Placeholder, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundstrat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thomas Lee<\/a>\u00a0Co-founder of Fundstrat, have done important, early, work on the value of utility tokens and network effects in blockchains. Chris Burniske rightly states that by definition each crypto-asset functions as a currency in the protocol economy it supports. Here, the equation of exchange (MV=PQ) can be used to determine the flow of money needed to support that economy, where M is the size of the monetary base necessary to support a crypto-economy of size PQ, at velocity V. Thomas Lee has worked on another equation called Metcalfe\u2019s law. Metcalfe\u2019s Law says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users in that network. Based on this model, Fundstrat found that 94% of bitcoin\u2019s price moves in the last four years can be explained. Unfortunately, however, the equation is more descriptive that predictive. Another technique being use is a ratio based valuation called Network Value to Transactions, or NVT. This has been dubbed the PE ratio for crypto. The main idea behind this is to relate the price of the crypto-asset to its fundamental use, in this case the daily volume of on-chain transactions. Despite these techniques, some crypto-assets don\u2019t fit neatly into any of these frameworks. As an example, investors are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a form of digital commodity, or gold 2.0. In this case, valuation can be determined by looking at bitcoin as a substitute to the gold market and simply deriving how much one bitcoin would be worth if it took, say, 5% of the today\u2019s gold market.<\/p>\n<p>In general, we still need much more research around the value of these new networks. Companies like\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/messari.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Messari<\/a>\u00a0are doing this by building a research database, but more needs to be done an even experts are making serious blunders in their valuations.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/multicoin.capital\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Multicoin Capital<\/a>\u00a0is a $50m hedge fund based in the US which has raised money from the likes of Marc Andreessen. They have publicly accessible research and valuation reports available on their website\u200a\u2014\u200aa really fantastic resource. Last week I had a look at their model for 0x. Apollo Capital happens to like the 0x project (we are not currently holders of the 0x token), and this partly is due to the difficulty in valuing its native token. Multicoin produced a model attempting to do just this but due to a simple mistake their valuation overvalued 0x by a factor 2\u20134x. This was the conversation that followed on Twitter with the co-founder of Multicoin,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KyleSamani?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kyle Samani<\/a>:<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527135468627_46391\" class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-text-ready\" data-block-type=\"5\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626319937713_128\" class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626319937713_127\" class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n\n        \" data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"><\/p>\n<figure id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626319937713_126\" class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"><\/p>\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626319937713_125\" class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n\n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \" data-animation-role=\"image\" data-animation-override=\"\"><img class=\"thumb-image loaded\" src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1527136487851-XAY1FHNQYW4JS4U2KCYS\/Henrik+Kyle+Samani.png?format=1000w\" alt=\"Henrik Kyle Samani.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1527136487851-XAY1FHNQYW4JS4U2KCYS\/Henrik+Kyle+Samani.png\" data-image=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1527136487851-XAY1FHNQYW4JS4U2KCYS\/Henrik+Kyle+Samani.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"418x533\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5b0640e6f950b7cb32c764d5\" data-type=\"image\" data-image-resolution=\"1000w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527135468627_49845\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p>Crypto is an area where even professional investors make simple errors which go undetected for a long time.

All the value in 0x might instead come from it being a governance token. I think it is fair to say we just don\u2019t know yet how to accurately value governance in blockchain networks, and that people don\u2019t understand the effect velocity will have on the value of their utility tokens.<\/p>\n<p>Binance Coin is another interesting example of the state of crypto valuation. Binance was a hugely successful ICO: after only 8 months they reported a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ccn.com\/binance-surpassed-germanys-biggest-bank-deutsche-in-profitability\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">higher profit in Q1 than 148 year old Deutsche Bank<\/a>. The use of the Binance Coin is outlined in their\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.binance.com\/resources\/ico\/Binance_WhitePaper_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">white paper<\/a>. In the first 4 years, Binance Coins gives users a discount on fees on their trading platform. After 4 years the only use of the Binance Coins will be on their yet to be built decentralised exchange.<\/p>\n<p>So how do we value Binance Coin? It\u2019s firstly important to remember that Binance is using a share of their Q1 profit to buy back up to 100M of the total 200M coins in circulation. We can now calculate the utility value for BNB the first 4 years and we can assume a circulating supply adjusted for the buyback. The problem is that, it is very hard to come up good assumptions after year 4 as there are just too many unknowns at this point. How do we not value Binance Coin?\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/bambouclub\/a-valuation-calculator-for-binance-coin-af3e18a579fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This blog post<\/a>\u00a0by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BambouClub\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@BambouClub<\/a>\u00a0is a good example. The writer applies a PE-ratio of 51 to the buyback. This of course makes no sense at all since we know there will ultimately be at least 100M coins in circulation, so we can just adjust the utility value with a lower coin count.
