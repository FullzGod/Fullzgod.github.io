Crypto assets are largely driven by a different investor base and are fundamentally unique. We believe that there is a strong argument for a small allocation to crypto assets within a broader portfolio, in part due to their lack of correlation to traditional assets.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Following the coronavirus market panic in March earlier this year, crypto assets have demonstrated a much higher level of correlation to traditional assets as markets have broadly recovered. We thought it timely to update our analysis and present our findings to investors.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">More recently, crypto assets are once again decoupling from equities as Bitcoin explodes to yearly highs above US$13,000 while the major US and Australian indices stagnate. We expect this decreasing correlation to continue as retail and institutional focus continues to turn towards crypto assets.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">The aftermath of the coronavirus market panic has been nothing short of extraordinary. It took less than 2 and a half months for the NASDAQ Composite to reclaim it\u2019s all time high after falling over 30% peak-to-trough. During this time, Bitcoin and crypto assets experienced a similar V- shaped recovery as markets became confident that the US Federal Reserve would do everything in its power to support markets.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">In March we witnessed a synchronised global flight to cash, from April onwards we witnessed a synchronised global flight to risk assets.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603940107392_17890\" class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-text-ready\" data-block-type=\"5\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626320527276_106\" class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626320527276_105\" class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-none\n          individual-animation-none\n          individual-text-animation-none\n        \" data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"><\/p>\n<figure id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626320527276_104\" class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"><\/p>\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626320527276_103\" class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n\n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \" data-animation-role=\"image\"><img class=\"thumb-image loaded\" src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1603945302706-FY7YVBBJ4QX4VVP0UL1O\/Screen+Shot+2020-10-22+at+11.15.31+am.png?format=1500w\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-22 at 11.15.31 am.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1603945302706-FY7YVBBJ4QX4VVP0UL1O\/Screen+Shot+2020-10-22+at+11.15.31+am.png\" data-image=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1603945302706-FY7YVBBJ4QX4VVP0UL1O\/Screen+Shot+2020-10-22+at+11.15.31+am.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"592x367\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5f9a43552c20e9662425e861\" data-type=\"image\" data-image-resolution=\"1500w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603940107392_21750\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p class=\"\">In previous blog posts on crypto correlations, we compared traditional assets to a hypothetical portfolio of the major crypto assets. The above graph shows the 12 month rolling correlation between the performance of the Apollo Capital Fund and the performance of Australian Equities, Australian Bonds and Gold.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">The Fund\u2019s correlation to Australian equities has been increasing significantly from March 2020 to present, this is likely attributable to coronavirus\u2019s impact on global markets. We believe that this high level of correlation is unlikely to continue as the crypto asset market develops.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Before COVID-19 the Fund had a small positive correlation with all three of these assets classes. However, since May of 2020 the Apollo Capital Fund has been increasingly uncorrelated to both Australian Bonds and Gold.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603940107392_23194\" class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-text-ready\" data-block-type=\"5\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626320527276_128\" class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626320527276_127\" class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-none\n          individual-animation-none\n          individual-text-animation-none\n        \" data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"><\/p>\n<figure id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626320527276_126\" class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"><\/p>\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626320527276_125\" class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n\n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \" data-animation-role=\"image\"><img class=\"thumb-image loaded\" src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1603945757404-WKR3ATT2DW814AQ0FDOU\/Screen+Shot+2020-10-29+at+3.28.47+pm.png?format=1500w\" alt=\"The above table shows the correlation between the monthly performance of the Apollo Capital Fund and the monthly performance of each asset class measured in AUD since the fund\u2019s inception (Feb 2018 - September 2020).\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1603945757404-WKR3ATT2DW814AQ0FDOU\/Screen+Shot+2020-10-29+at+3.28.47+pm.png\" data-image=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1603945757404-WKR3ATT2DW814AQ0FDOU\/Screen+Shot+2020-10-29+at+3.28.47+pm.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"632x192\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5f9a451d44769a76c8fac136\" data-type=\"image\" data-image-resolution=\"1500w\" \/><\/div><figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n<p class=\"\">The above table shows the correlation between the monthly performance of the Apollo Capital Fund and the monthly performance of each asset class measured in AUD since the fund\u2019s inception (Feb 2018 &#8211; September 2020).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603940107392_27017\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p class=\"\">The relatively high correlation between the fund\u2019s returns and equities is largely a result of the increased correlation experienced after the coronavirus sell off.\u00a0Unsurprisingly, the fund has demonstrated little correlation to Australian Bonds, International Bonds and Gold.
