The Sharpe Ratio determines how much an investor is compensated per unit of risk taken on. It is calculated by determining the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate (in this case the 10 year Australian government bond return) per unit of volatility. Generally, the greater the value of the Sharpe ratio, the more attractive the risk-adjusted return. It\u2019s a really useful way to analyse crypto assets because while the returns have been substantial, so has the asset class\u2019 volatility.<\/p>\n<p>We can see that for these portfolios investors have been compensated generously for any added volatility in the portfolio due to crypto assets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Three Take-Aways<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1.

Efficient Frontier, Optimised<\/p>\n<p>An \u2018efficient frontier\u2019 of portfolios can be built, where returns are optimised per unit of risk.<\/p>\n<p>As we\u2019ve seen, crypto assets aren\u2019t correlated with other asset classes, and they have experienced significant capital growth. These attributes make it ideal in portfolio construction. Despite this, the vast majority of portfolios fail to include even a small amount. We believe that this omission means that current portfolios are less than ideally constructed.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that the efficient frontier shifts up if we include crypto assets in our portfolio. In other words, the risk-return profile can improve with the inclusion of crypto assets.<\/p>\n<p>3. Barbell Investing with Crypto assets<\/p>\n<p>The barbell investment thesis was made famous by Nicholas Nassim Taleb, the investor and author.<\/p>\n<p>The barbell theory\u2019s prime directive is unambiguous:\u00a0Stay as far from the middle as possible.\u00a0Taleb invests in emerging, even speculative, investment products with very high potential upside; his other investments are the safest possible assets to invest in.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you know that you are vulnerable to prediction errors, and \u2026 accept that most \u201crisk measures\u201d are flawed, then your strategy is to be as hyperconservative and hyperaggressive as you can be instead of being mildly aggressive or conservative.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Nicholas Nassim Taleb<\/p>\n<p>Crypto fits very comfortably into the barbell investment thesis. Crypto assets remain a small asset class that still shows very high volatility.\u00a0Because crypto has the potential to reengineer large swathes of the economy, we believe an investor has high potential upside.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1533250013348_32928\" class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-text-ready\" data-block-type=\"5\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626322418058_162\" class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626322418058_161\" class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n\n        \" data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"><\/p>\n<figure id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626322418058_160\" class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"><\/p>\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626322418058_159\" class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n\n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \" data-animation-role=\"image\" data-animation-override=\"\"><img class=\"thumb-image loaded\" src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1533251874778-V5SR4EFF6W0TVAWP8SRJ\/Screen+Shot+2018-08-03+at+9.17.35+am.png?format=1500w\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-08-03 at 9.17.35 am.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1533251874778-V5SR4EFF6W0TVAWP8SRJ\/Screen+Shot+2018-08-03+at+9.17.35+am.png\" data-image=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1533251874778-V5SR4EFF6W0TVAWP8SRJ\/Screen+Shot+2018-08-03+at+9.17.35+am.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1912x1059\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5b639120352f53fe3055d00b\" data-type=\"image\" data-image-resolution=\"1500w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1533250013348_33208\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p>All the while, by keeping an investors position small, to between 2\u201310%, the downward risk is minimised while remaining sufficiently exposed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This analysis has demonstrated that including a small portion of crypto assets in a diversified, Australian portfolio of stocks and bonds has greatly benefited investors.\u00a0<strong>This is not only from a capital growth perspective but also from a risk\/reward perspective.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Even when the downside is limited (2% of a diversified portfolio), the upside has been shown to be very substantial (responsible for almost 50% of total returns).\u00a0As large international investors are waking up to the opportunity of crypto assets, we believe now its time to pay attention.<br \/>\n<em><a href=\"http:\/\/apollocap.io\/\">Apollo Capital is Australia\u2019s premier crypto fund<\/a>, allowing sophisticated wholesale investors to gain access to investment opportunities within the crypto asset market.
