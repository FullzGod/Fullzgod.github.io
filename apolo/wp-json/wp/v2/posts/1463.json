These broader changes have harmed DeFi TVL. However, the fundamentals of what makes a strong DeFi ecosystem in the long term have not varied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Fundamentals of Strong DeFi Ecosystems<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few key fundamentals contribute to an ecosystem&#8217;s strength and success in the DeFi sector. The first attribute of a vibrant DeFi ecosystem is a Decentralised Exchange (DEX) with high liquidity and high Total Value Locked (TVL). Traditionally successful DEXs will also have native tokens to incentivise liquidity. The largest DEXs in the market today are Uniswap and Curve. These protocols incentivise users to provide the automated market maker with liquidity for transaction fees and tokens &#8211; a current strategy we implement in our ACOF is allocating capital to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/curve.fi\/musd\/deposit\">Curve mUSD pool<\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to earn an annual yield of 7.84%. For an in-depth description and demo of how DEXs operate, please refer to our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PHxgK2gDzcs&amp;t=3s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8216;DeFi Explained&#8217;<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> video covering the DEX SushiSwap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second ingredient to a thriving DeFi blockchain is to have strong, decentralised money markets (borrowing and lending protocols) that are trustworthy and reliable. Trust and reliability are commonly measured in the TVL the platforms can garner. Users feel more comfortable interacting and depositing capital into protocols that have become battle-hardened through time in the market and those that have undergone excessive code audits. Protocols that hit this profile are Aave and Compound. They are considered the most trusted protocols in this DeFi category and span multiple blockchains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last fundamental contributor to a flourishing DeFi ecosystem is the incentive programs and strategic marketing. Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche are all crypto assets held by Apollo Capital and have had their growth catalysed by large scale incentive programs targeting both developers and users. These incentive programs allocate the blockchain&#8217;s native token to protocols and yield farmers to promote TVL growth and development.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here we can see Avalanche is running an incentive program on one of the largest and most trusted money market protocols, AAVE. In addition, the interest in the token a DeFi user can earn supplying it. The user can also earn wrapped AVAX as a reward for utilising the AAVE.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1467 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/AAVE-example--1024x645.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/AAVE-example--1024x645.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/AAVE-example--300x189.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/AAVE-example--768x484.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/AAVE-example--1536x968.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/AAVE-example--1568x988.jpg 1568w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/AAVE-example-.jpg 1696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without well-established decentralised exchanges and money market protocols, blockchains will naturally have a lower TVL than other ecosystems. Algorand is another asset held by Apollo Capital with a relatively low TVL compared to another layer one chain with its decentralised money market, AlgoFi and decentralised exchange Tinyman, both still in their infancy. However, smaller ecosystems in the top 100 crypto assets such as Alogrand have the potential to increase if their dApps gain traction and strategic liquidity incentives are initiated. Ecosystems such as Solana, Avalanche and Polygon covered in this article make fantastic examples of TVL growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Current TVL in Crypto 2022<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The TVL in decentralised finance (DeFi) is currently at its lowest point in 2022. TVL has dropped from over $240B in January to around $107.6B today (-55%). This decline is due to crypto and macroeconomic factors. Luna&#8217;s failure has brought the public&#8217;s attention to DeFi. The world witnessed a $30B TVL loss in Luna&#8217;s ecosystem and represented a large proportion of TVL in DeFi. This recent event has shaken the whole DeFi sector, so we have seen recent reductions in TVL of most layer one ecosystems. Decreasing token price locked up contributes to a decrease in TVL, and the crypto market&#8217;s current correlation to the broader equities markets has also been another contributor. By the end of April 2022, the S&amp;P 500 recorded a loss of 13.8%, its worst start to the year since World War II. This negative sentiment generated from the federal reserve rate hikes and global supply constraints flowed into DeFi asset valuations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This graph illustrates the adoption of DeFi before the onset of adverse macroeconomic factors at the beginning of 2022 and the collapse of Luna (Terra) in early May 2022.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1460 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/DeFi-Ecosystem.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"737\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/DeFi-Ecosystem.jpg 737w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/DeFi-Ecosystem-300x180.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Total Value Locked in Ethereum<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethereum is the market leader in DeFi ecosystems.

With a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TVL of $69.7B, its dominance stands at almost 65% of the total TVL in DeFi. MakerDao (MKR), built on the Ethereum network, is the largest DeFi project with a current TVL of<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> $9.5B (8.75% dominance in the DeFi sector ) from a high of $18B at the beginning of 2022. MakerDao is Ethereum&#8217;s largest money market, allowing for lending and borrowing of digital assets. MakerDao is also the protocol behind the most decentralised over-collateralised stablecoin DAI. Ethereum also supports the leading decentralised exchange (DEX) in DeFi, Uniswap, which currently has a TVL of $5.55B and has recently surpassed $1 trillion in transaction volume. Ethereum is the well-established market leader in DeFi it is not as reliant on incentive programs to entice more TVL.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Key Statistics<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Represents 65% of TVL in Defi.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The network supports the largest DeFi project and money market (MakerDao) and the largest DEX (Uniswap).\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, $69.7B TVL in Ethereum, reaching an annual high of $150B at the start of January 2022.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1459\" src=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Ethereum-Ecosystem.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"852\" height=\"415\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Ethereum-Ecosystem.jpg 852w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Ethereum-Ecosystem-300x146.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Ethereum-Ecosystem-768x374.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Total Value Locked in Binance Smart Chain\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a layer one blockchain built for easy and secure smart contract applications.

Binance Smart Chain&#8217;s leading protocol is PancakeSwap, a widely trusted DEX that accounts for over 46% of the network&#8217;s TVL. PancakeSwap is currently the second-largest DEX in the entire DeFi space and is a significant reason BSC has had a successful start in decentralised finance. Venus Protocol is BSC&#8217;s largest and most trusted money market <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that enables lending, borrowing, and credit on digital assets<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; TVL of $817.5M.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Binance also dedicated $1B to growth the Binance Smart Chain in October 2021, with $100M allocated to developing and supporting DeFi protocols. Another clever method Binance utilises to help increase the price of their native token BNB and, in turn, increase TVL is to decrease the supply of BNB every quarter via a token burn. The token burn will stop once the total supply reaches 100,000,000 BNB (currently 163,276,974).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Key Statistics<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accounts for 8.0% of TVL in DeFi.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PancakeSwap is the second-largest DEX in crypto after Uniswap.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venus Protocol (XVS) is BSC&#8217;s largest money market.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, $8.6B TVL in Solana, reaching an annual high of $17.4B at the beginning of January 2022.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Significant amounts of BNB are removed (burnt) each quarter.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1458\" src=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Binance-Ecosystem-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"849\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Binance-Ecosystem-.jpg 849w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Binance-Ecosystem--300x152.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.apollocap.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Binance-Ecosystem--768x390.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Total Value Locked in Avalanche<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avalanche is a top tier Proof-of-Stake (PoS) smart contract protocol and is currently ranked #4 for largest TVL.
