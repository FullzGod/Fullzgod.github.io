One reason why this is the case is that blockchains are only able to secure native blockchain assets and smart contracts related to those assets. Non-native blockchain assets like identity will be hard to secure using open blockchains. Furthermore, anchoring non-native blockchain assets like identity doesn\u2019t necessary capture a lot of value in crypto assets. In many cases non financial use cases end up anchoring information (e.g. through a hash) to a secure blockchain like Bitcoin. This can be done relatively cheaply using only a nominal amount of bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">For these reasons, financial related verticals and the crypto assets underpinning these verticals are our investment focus at Apollo Capital, specifically:<\/p>\n<ul data-rte-list=\"default\">\n<li>\n<p class=\"\">Store of Value<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"\">Privacy Coins<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"\">Stablecoins<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"\">Open Financial System<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"\">These financial verticals will create an infrastructure layer for financial primitives that are:<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">1. Permissionless\u200a\u2014\u200aaccessible to anyone. Just like the Internet made the world\u2019s information accessible to everyone with a smartphone, open blockchains will make financial infrastructure available to everyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. And just like the Internet broke down the barrier for publishing information on the Internet, anyone will be able to create financial instruments by interacting with smart contracts.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">2. Trustless\u200a\u2014\u200anot dependent on a third-party but on auditable software. Just like the information on Wikipedia is not dependent on one third-party actor but a network of contributors, the financial infrastructure of the future will not be dependent on a single vulnerable actor like a bank, state or financial institution.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">3. Censorship resistant\u200a\u2014\u200afinancial freedom. The Internet is hard to censor, in the future our financial system will be hard to censor as the Open Financial System is borderless in nature and not tethered to geographical jurisdictions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Once the basic layer is built, composability of these building blocks will lead to more advanced financial primitives to emerge and finally to user interfaces through web and mobile applications.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Store of Value<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Bitcoin as a potential store of value and unseizable asset not relying on a government is material. Gold and offshore accounts today account for tens of trillions in value. Properties of crypto assets such as Bitcoin are on many accounts better than our current versions. In addition crypto assets are programmable which opens up new avenues for innovation not possible with a physical commodity such as gold. Store of value doesn\u2019t exclude other use cases such as payments, but in our view volatility needs to decrease before a store of value enters the real competition for other properties of money such as medium of exchange and unit of account.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Medium of Exchange<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"\">In this category we mainly have stablecoins and privacy coins. Stablecoins suffer from a trilemma trying to optimise on scalability, stability and decentralisation. This is a hard problem to solve but where we see a lot of innovation. There is massive potential in the coming decade for stablecoins that can get this equation right. It is likely that in the very long term stablecoins will find competition from more pure crypto assets not tied to a peg once the volatility of those assets starts declining.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Privacy coins enable private transactions to take place and is an interesting and fast evolving vertical besides cryptocurrencies running an open transaction graph. As privacy coins tend to be innovative using newly developed cryptography, there is generally a higher technology risk in this vertical versus non privacy enabled coins.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Open Financial System<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"\">This is a general term referring to a new financial system being built on top of open blockchains. The first financial primitives being built include:<\/p>\n<ul data-rte-list=\"default\">\n<li>\n<p class=\"\">Lending\u200a\u2014\u200abeing able to earn an interest rate on assets that you already hold.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"\">Credit markets\u200a\u2014\u200aborrow against assets that you hold in your portfolio.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"\">Prediction and oracles\u200a\u2014\u200acreate a trustless source of truth for events outside blockchains.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"\">Derivatives\u200a\u2014\u200aa leverage bet on an underlying asset.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"\">Decentralised exchanges \u2014blockchain based trading without giving up custody of your assets.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"\">Synthetic assets\u200a\u2014\u200ablockchain assets that can trustlessly replicate non-blockchain assets.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"\">While many of the above primitives are still experimental in nature, it is easy to see them in the future vastly outcompete traditional solutions at least in certain categories and circumstances. As an example, taking out a loan on a blockchain can be as easy as a few clicks on a web 3 enabled browser.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Running financial services on software instead of relying on trusted financial institutions not only opens up access but could lead to substantial gains in productivity as the financial sector in many countries makes up a very substantial part of the GDP.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Core to our thesis is that the financial infrastructure being built on open blockchains will become a common utility not unlike the Internet itself.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1559617263216_29335\" class=\"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\" data-block-type=\"47\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a fast moving field like crypto assets we believe in the merit of having an investment thesis that is not set in stone but is updated as the market evolves.
