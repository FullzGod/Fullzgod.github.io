By including a headline from a newspaper, Satoshi proved it also didn\u2019t take place beforehand. No one cheated, it was fair game with no undue advantage.<\/li>\n<li>It wasn\u2019t any message. Bitcoin has libertarian roots. The launch of Bitcoin took place during the last financial crises and and the headline talks about <strong>\u2018bailout for banks\u2019<\/strong>. Bitcoin unlike the banking system is not based on debt but offers an alternative form of money, a digital bearer instrument.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ten years later Bitcoin has had an extremely consistent existence. Blocks are found about every 10 minutes, 24\/7, 365, transactions are being confirmed and the network is growing. This is despite it being completely open, not controlled by anyone. It has endured an endless amount of technical and social attacks through the years.<\/p>\n<p>The longer an idea or a technology (really anything non-perishable) has been around without failing, the longer its future life expectancy\u200a\u2014\u200athis is what author Nassim N. Taleb refers to as the <em>Lindy Effect<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>We at Apollo Capital think that together with Network effect, the Lindy effect is key when looking at crypto assets. The network effect is why Bitcoin and other crypto assets have value despite having no IP, the code can be copied. The Lindy effect is the reason Gold has a value of USD 8\u201310tr while Bitcoin is at 68bn\u200a\u2014\u200aless than 1% of Gold\u2019s value. Gold has been around for a much longer time. The fact that Bitcoin has been around un-harmed <em>despite<\/em> all that has been thrown at it for the past 10 years bodes well for the next 10 years\u200a\u2014\u200ait actually gives it more strength.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the debt level in the banking system that caused the financial crises of 2008 is much less, however the total debt level in the world is at record levels.
