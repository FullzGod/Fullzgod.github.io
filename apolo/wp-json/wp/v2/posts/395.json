The gist of that article was that more and more major industries and businesses were being run on software. Thus it would makes sense to invest in this new infrastructure despite the market creating a dot com bubble at the end of 90s.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that crypto assets are powering a new generation of software and that this software has the power to disrupt many of today\u2019s industries and businesses which in turn are run on software. However, we are not just talking about a new generation of software that is replacing the current system, we are talking about something much bigger\u200a\u2014\u200asoftware that is displacing current business models. Just like Amazon disrupted bookstores, this new generation of software called crypto networks will disrupt some of today\u2019s businesses built on software.<\/p>\n<p>This new paradigm involving crypto assets that ends up with Software Eating Software is likely to play out in a gradual fashion going through different phases. Below I outline a possible scenario how it might play out:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1\u200a\u2014\u200aSoftware Eating Commodities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Digital scarcity was the first application of crypto assets. Bitcoin like gold is scarce but is superior in many other ways through the power of being based on software. Bitcoin is programmable, can be stored more easily than a physical commodity, it can be sent quickly and effortlessly like an email, it can be easily divided and unlike gold its authenticity can be easily verified with software.<\/p>\n<p>So in phase 1 of this crypto based revolution we have digital scarce objects and specifically Bitcoin as a digital Gold:<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1553554939738_21200\" class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-text-ready\" data-block-type=\"5\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626316134155_128\" class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626316134155_127\" class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-none\n          individual-animation-none\n          individual-text-animation-none\n        \" data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"><\/p>\n<figure id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626316134155_126\" class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"><\/p>\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1626316134155_125\" class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n\n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \" data-animation-role=\"image\"><img class=\"thumb-image loaded\" src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1553555039782-OWI7VEVP5UI46I288RHZ\/Screen+Shot+2019-03-26+at+8.35.06+am.png?format=1500w\" alt=\"A physical commodity like gold can be displaced with a crypto network like Bitcoin.\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1553555039782-OWI7VEVP5UI46I288RHZ\/Screen+Shot+2019-03-26+at+8.35.06+am.png\" data-image=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a0cee3fbce1765c3ce8885c\/1553555039782-OWI7VEVP5UI46I288RHZ\/Screen+Shot+2019-03-26+at+8.35.06+am.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1470x418\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5c995e53652dea951a0b591d\" data-type=\"image\" data-image-resolution=\"1500w\" \/><\/div><figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n<p>A physical commodity like gold can be displaced with a crypto network like Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1553554939738_25188\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p><strong>Phase 2\u200a\u2014\u200aSoftware Eating Contracts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the second phase we have software performing simple contracts.
