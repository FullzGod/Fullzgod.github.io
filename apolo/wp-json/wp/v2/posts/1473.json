It is this process that makes WealthBriefing awards so prized amongst winners.<\/p>\n<p>The WealthBriefringAsia Awards are part of a global programme run by WealthBriefingAsia and its sister publications WealthBriefing and Family Wealth Report, encompassing all of the world\u2019s major wealth management centres.<\/p>\n<p>Participants around the world recognise that winning awards is particularly important in these challenging times as it gives clients a reassurance in the solidity and sustainability of the winner\u2019s business and operating model.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Commenting on the firm\u2019s triumph, Henrik Andersson, CIO, Apollo Capital said:<\/strong> &#8220;We are delighted to be recognised in this award from WealthBriefing Asia. We at Apollo Capital have worked incredibly hard since our founding nearly four and half years ago, to stand by our tagline and bring \u2018Institutional Asset Management to a New Asset Class.\u2019 We are thrilled to have received this award, in recognition of our efforts and strong performance delivered to investors. Since expanding to Singapore nearly 12 months ago, we have been delighted with the reception from the Asian markets and continue to be impressed by their enthusiasm to learn about and invest in crypto assets.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>ClearView Financial Media\u2019s CEO, and Publisher of WealthBriefing, Stephen Harris, was the first to extend his congratulations to all the winners. He said:<\/strong> \u201cThe organisations and individuals who triumphed in these awards are all worthy winners, and I would like to extend my heartiest congratulations to the winners and to those who have put so much work into each winning submission.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is clear that the judges valued and recognised Apollo Capital\u2019s strong performance and approach to investing in crypto assets. These awards were independently and expertly judged solely on the basis of entrants\u2019 submissions and their responses to a number of specific questions, which were answered by focusing on the client experience rather than purely quantitative performance metrics. That is unique, and I believe, compelling feature. These awards recognise the very best operators in Asia wealth management, with \u2018independence\u2019, \u2018integrity\u2019 and \u2018genuine insight\u2019 the watchwords of the judging process &#8211; such that the awards truly reflect excellence in Asia wealth management.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For media enquiries, journalists should contact:<br \/>\nName: Cici Lu<br \/>\nTitle: Managing Partner Asia<br \/>\nCompany: Apollo Capital \/ Pilgrim Partners Asia<br \/>\nTelephone number\/s +65 92969205<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOTES TO EDITORS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>1.
